Anyscale offer (cheap, fast) API access to Llama 2, so they’re not an unbiased source of information—but I really hope their claim here that Llama 2 70B provides almost equivalent summarization quality to GPT-4 holds up. Summarization is one of my favourite applications of LLMs, partly because it’s key to being able to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation against your own documents—where snippets of relevant documents are fed to the model and used to answer a user’s question. Having a really high performance openly licensed summarization model is a very big deal. <a href="/2023/Aug/30/llama-2-summaries/" rel="bookmark">#</a> <a href="/2023/Aug/30/">30th August 2023</a>, 2:37 pm</p>

<div class="blogmark segment"><p><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html#installation">LLM can now be installed directly from Homebrew</a> (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/124" title="Issue: Submit LLM to Homebrew">via</a>) I spent a bunch of time on this at the weekend: my LLM tool for interacting with large language models from the terminal has now been accepted into Homebrew core, and can be installed directly using “brew install llm”. I was previously running my own separate tap, but having it in core means that it benefits from Homebrew’s impressive set of build systems—each release of LLM now has Bottles created for it automatically across a range of platforms, so “brew install llm” should quickly download binary assets rather than spending several minutes installing dependencies the slow way. <a href="/2023/Jul/24/llm-homebrew/" rel="bookmark">#</a> <a href="/2023/Jul/24/">24th July 2023</a>, 5:16 pm</p>

ChatGPT added a new “custom instructions” feature today, which you can use to customize the system prompt used to control how it responds to you. swyx prompt-inject extracted the way it works:<br><br>“The user provided the following information about themselves. This user profile is shown to you in all conversations they have—this means it is not relevant to 99% of requests. Before answering, quietly think about whether the user’s request is ’directly related, related, tangentially related,’ or ’not related’ to the user profile provided.”<br><br>I’m surprised to see OpenAI using “quietly think about...” in a prompt like this—I wouldn’t have expected that language to be necessary. <a href="/2023/Jul/20/custom-instructions/" rel="bookmark">#</a> <a href="/2023/Jul/20/">20th July 2023</a>, 7:03 pm</p>

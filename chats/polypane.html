So I got through the first chapter in the instruction course, which was all text and input based, like fill in your name, fill in your address. Here's your nice looking address card in the DOS terminal that was prompt. But then chapter two started and it was like, okay, now draw a chessboard on the screen. And that was kind of a too big a leap for me at that point. Okay. Yeah. So I kind of forgot about that. But in the meantime, I had also discovered that websites were also built with code. So I started playing around with that, you know, making my own little websites, first in words, then in front page, then editing the things in Notepad. And it just kind of went from there. </blockquote></li>

And what that meant was that in Sketch, you had this one big canvas and you could put your mobile and your tablet and your desktop designs on that one canvas side by side. So you had a really good overview of your website at different sizes as you're designing it. And it made things really easy to compare and check if you're, for example, consistent. If things become larger in a way that is actually buildable, which at the time, very often, front-end developers would get very annoyed because a design on desktop and a design on mobile had nothing to do with each other. And having them side by side like that just made that really, really obvious. So that was a real productivity boost. But then you went back to the browser. No, I had designed a website and then I went to implement it. And suddenly all of that was gone. And I was just staring at one thing at a time again and having to resize my browser, et cetera. So I got really annoyed. And the thing I do when I get really annoyed is I build something to fix the issue. So I built this really small prototype that was essentially three iFrames duct taped together with an address bar above it. And then at some point, you have to name a thing. And it just popped into my head, like Polypane. It has alliteration. It means the thing. There's multiple panes, windows, or view ports. So that's what it started out as. Let me see my website in these bunch of different permutations that I need to build for so that I don't have to do all that stuff manually. </blockquote></li>

Well, essentially not like iFrames, because iFrames have all sorts of rights that you don't actually want them to have in this situation. So right now, the app uses something called web views, which Polypane is based on Electron, which uses Chromium for the rendering. So it inherits a bunch of these Chromium things that you don't really get if you're building websites, like there is no concept of a web view on your website. But it is something in Chrome, the browser, where they use these things to show different different web content that isn't websites. So you can use that in Electron. And the way that's actually implemented is that under the hood, it is a regular iFrame. So it's technically an out of process iFrame, which is nice because then it doesn't interact with whatever page it's being shown in. And then there's a web view wrapper that makes it so that you can interact with it on like a system level where you can inspect the network and change properties of the renderer itself. </blockquote></li>

Because they're user agents, if they can get something on the screen for the user, and it mostly works and they can mostly interact with it, then that's a win for the browser. So they actually hide a whole lot of things you could consider issues because for the regular user, for a user that has full motor capabilities and perfect eyesight, etc, they won't notice these things. So I have to flip that around in my browser and actually make it easy to figure out where the browser tries to compensate for lack of quality. </blockquote></li>

And it's not, you know, when you shrink it down, it's not there anymore, because it's just hidden. It's like, well, it's not critical. We can't really fit it on the screen.

So in this example, if you have a link that's available in one of the pains, but not in all the others, because of sizing, what the browser does is it first tries to sync the click event. And that click event might trigger a navigation event. So the browser will wait a bit upon acting upon that navigation event to see what happens in all the other pains, because if all the other pains also start a navigation event, then the browser just has to follow. It has to receive the new URL and then display it, but it doesn't actually have to instruct all the pains to go to that URL. But then if that doesn't happen, you know, if that click can't be synced, then we fall back to syncing the navigation, the URL instead, it's preferable to have the click synced because then you have all these benefits of intact history, et cetera. But, you know, at the end of a cycle like that, the main goal for Polypane is that all pains show the same page. There's this fallback mechanism to it. </blockquote></li>

The web content showing your website isn't part of the developer tools. All the browser Chrome isn't part of the developer tools. They're locked away because that's what the regular product demands. If 99% of your users are developers, you definitely don't want them to accidentally stumble upon the developer tools because they think they'll have hacked their entire computer or whatever.

I have to do some trickery to display it in a place that isn't right next to the pane or inside a pane. But other than that, I get the entire Chromium developer tools for free, but the Chromium developer tools are built to interact with a single web page at a time. If you're in Polypane and you want to change some stuff, edit some content or change some colors or edit some CSS, then obviously you would want that to happen in all the panes at once because that's the thing it does. So I've also built my own Elements Inspector and my own console to enable that, where they consolidate the styling from all the panes and the DOM from all the panes. And then allow you to edit that in each pane in one go. So that took a whole lot of work and it still definitely doesn't do everything that the Chromium Elements Inspector does. But I think the 80-20 rule, you can definitely get very, very far with just the Polypane Elements Inspector. </blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Kilian Valkhof</cite>:  Where if you use container queries on your page, then the size of certain elements is going to influence the styling of their descendants, the elements inside of them. So in an Elements Inspector, you want to know whether or not you reach that container threshold and then show the styling that is actually being applied. While for media queries, you can use JavaScript with window.matchmedia to figure out which media query is actually true for the current page at this current time. For containers, that doesn't exist. So if you have in your CSS like at container minimum width of 400 pixels, then there's nothing that you can ask the browser to say, you know, is this element, does it match this container query? Or is this container query valid for this element? Essentially, I had to implement that myself. So I now have a whole bunch of codes that can take an element and a matched container query, and then figure out whether or not that container query actually applies at this moment. And unfortunately, what that comes down to is a whole lot of parsing strings. Because if you think of a container query, let's say it's, let's keep it simple, and it's just the inline size, it's just the width. There are actually like five or so different notations that you can use to say, is this thing wider than 400 pixels? You can do min width, you can do width greater than, you can do number smaller than width, you can do ranged media query, so you can put width in the middle and then have two values side by side. So you have to look through all of those cases and see, you know, which one is the user actually trying to convey, and then which is actually the value. And is it for width or inline size, or is it for block size for height? So it's a whole bunch of if statements, essentially. And at the end, I know whether or not a given block of CSS is actually being applied to the page or not. Of course, all of that would have been much less work if I could have just done like element dot match container. But that doesn't exist. At least it doesn't exist yet. They're working on it, it's specced, but it's not in browsers yet. So when it lands, I can delete a whole bunch of code, which is, you know, deleting code is always nice. So I look forward to that. But for now, this is what I have to do to make stuff like that work. </blockquote></li>

A couple of episodes ago, we did two back to back with novel engines that are being developed. So Servo recently Igalia came and picked up where Mozilla left off on Servo. We're really helping champion in that with some new funding. And we also talk about Ladybird, which I think at the time didn't have any funding. And it seems that it's recently getting some, which is nice. But your browser is interesting in sort of both regards in that it is it's not a novel engine. </blockquote></li>

So like a large number of features are things that I would never have come up with. And it's just some person emailing me, you know, I get everything from like a single line, like wouldn't it be cool if it did X? To, I've mocked up this demo video of a new feature that I think you should add. And it's like the most polished thing ever. And everything in between. But like you said, paying for browsers is weird. And on top of that, developers are very much used to not paying for their tooling, increasingly so. So that is, you know, a hard battle. You really have to convince people that this is actually worth the price of admission. You know, that's what the product needs to do. It really needs to convince people. And part of that is also, you know, what I found is that a lot of developers, they don't consider their own time to be worth anything. So saving time isn't really interesting to them. So even if they're faster, then that doesn't mean that they think it's worth it. Whereas if they take that equation and they show to their manager, you know, their manager might cry. So I, you know, part of like my marketing, if you will, is, you know, helping developers figure out that, you know, actually, the time you spend and the work you do have value. And that means that you can ask your employer for stuff that makes the time you spend more effective, more efficient, more fun. And your employer will be happy to do that. Because if you as a developer are happy and productive, that means that, you know, the work is getting done better. It's of higher quality. There's no less remedial work you have to do later on. So it's better for everyone. But you don't get to that point if you don't realize at the beginning, like my time is valuable.

                  <blockquote><cite>Kilian Valkhof</cite>:  But the thing that I haven't really figured out yet, or cracked is that this is time saved during development. And some of that is literally you're not resizing your browser, which takes seconds. But if you do that dozens or hundreds of times a day, over a month, that really adds up. And it, you know, resizing your browser isn't intellectually stimulating. So probably don't want to do that. But the real value is in all the stuff that you don't miss during development. Because we all know that when you as a developer think you're done, and the website goes live, and it shipped to users, and then a couple of months late or a couple of weeks later, it turns out that you weren't done at all. You missed a whole bunch of stuff. And for various reasons, that only came up now, because, you know, now people are interacting with the site, or now the customer finally looks at it. Now it has content. So they actually understand what's going on, all these things. But what happens is that, no, you work on a project, you think it's done, you ship it, you start working on another project. And then your manager comes back, and he says, you know, that project from a month ago. Yeah, here's a word file with all the stuff you need to fix, or JIRA tickets, or whatever. And at that point, it's so much more time intensive, and annoying to go back to that project, and figure out where everything is, and fix the things, and validate it, and then ship it again. Compared to during development, you already found that weird breakpoints where you missed that things are actually now two columns, and they don't quite fit. But it's not an iPhone, and it's not an iPad, it's right in the middle. And you never bother checking that if you don't use Polypane, whereas in Polypane, that sort of comes up naturally. So you see that you can fix it because you're working on it anyway, and move on with your day, and you never end up having that remedial work, or, you know, never say never, but you get a whole lot less issues, because you catch all these things during development. And as you can tell, for how long this explanation was, it's very hard to explain people that that's what's happening. </blockquote></li>

But also, you have this ability to do like a screenshot of the whole thing, right? And that would be typically much harder to do. If you're trying to do this manually, like I've tried to do that, where you manually finagling these windows, you know, trying to get them so that you can get a nice screenshot with no noise or anything. So I mean, I'm totally sold that it's worth it for somebody who builds websites to have a tool like this at that price. And that blows my mind, because at the beginning of this, I thought that was not a thing that I would agree with. Yeah, I mean, I can see the usefulness and when I think about what it costs you to save, that it definitely will, it's definitely worth that much to a lot of people, I think.

And then all the browsers, even Chrome are downstream of that. And the way you can easily get market share is to ship it on a device that you also make, right? Or with an operating system that you also make. And that just inevitably, the power of defaults is very strong, right? You will capture a very, very significant overwhelming portion of the people who use that operating system or buy that product. And so there are some downstream products that have significant share. And they also frequently then have their own stores, which they monetize, and they can monetize their default search. So they can be lucrative even. And there's nothing in open source that says they have to contribute anything back. And I certainly don't want to imply that somebody who can just, you know, the product more or less breaks even or something like that, they also should pay back. But I think that there is some point where things start getting very lucrative, where you would hope that people would want to put back into the system that supports them, do you know what I mean? </blockquote></li>

So instead of learning C++ is what it comes down to. I end up fixing it in my own product. But for example, I have Chromium extension and Firefox and Opera, etc. called FixAlly. And what that does is it automatically fixes contrast issues on webpages. And that's available for free on all the browsers that I can put it on. And that uses the same technology that Polypane uses to suggest colors for contrast issues. And instead, it just applies them. So you can toggle that on as an end user.

On the one hand, they can do that. And I'm also proud that my ideas were good enough for multi-billion-dollar companies to also implement. And the people that are implementing them, I am in contact with them. And they're all very nice people. And they all share the same enthusiasm I have about developer tooling. So there's nothing insidious there. We were literally all just trying to build the best thing for developers. However, a developer working on Chrome or on Edge, they don't have to worry about the longevity of their company. They can just build and ship because those companies will keep existing. Because they have income from wildly different things than the browser. For me, however, this is my income, my job. So having a huge company in the most banal way takes something I came up with and then give it away for free. I have very mixed feelings about that. All in all, though, I don't think that those browsers are ever going to let the developer tools break out of their box. What I've done in Polypane really requires everything about the browser to be DevTools-focused. That's just not going to work for a browser where the vast majority of users should never see developer tooling. So I hope that that's where the balance is. </blockquote></li>

There is so much in version 16.4, just even as compared to 16.3.This is kind of the amazing thing that, I mean, for years, Safari was the slow browser that barely pushed anything. And now it's completely the opposite. There's stuff coming out with every point release. And, you know, just the top line on this one, Safari 16.4, if you look at the blog post,135 new web features and over 280, what they call polish updates, which is improving things that were already there. Chats are usually about an hour.We could not possibly cover everything in an hour.</blockquote></li>

Um, so, uh, the last one was 16.3. That was only in January. So like you were saying, it used to be the, you know, once or twice a year kind of updates, and we're certainly not at that point anymore. We just had 16.3 in January. Uh, I think that's like the end of January too. Um, but you know, when you go back and you look at those comparatively, like even. On the left bar is the, the author and the date. And the thing that jumped out at me is that, you know, normally the author is like Jon Davis, Jen Simmons, right? Like it's one person, you know, they're the release notes for this release. 16.4 is like 10 people, right? Listed as authors. There's so much in here.It is just like an astoundingly big release.I know that there are people who speculate about like why and want to tie that to all different kinds of things. We're not going to do that. I'm happy that it's a great release.And we just want to talk about a bunch of cool things. We can't talk about all the cool things that are in there because there's too much. But, um, I think it's really exciting to see this kind of energy happening and these, these huge, huge releases that is just full of great stuff.</blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: Yeah. So people who have used like LESS or SASS are probably used to mix-ins that do color mixing or a color modification where you can shade you can lighten a color by saying something like,'I want the color of this element to be this other color, except 20% lighter or 30% darker,' something like that. So you can shade a given, let's say a color variable so that you don't have to compute the exact, like RGB or HSL or whatever values for that shade or that tint and just say, just do this. Like I want you to mix. And that's what the CSS relative color syntax permits.It takes that sort of that preprocessor capability and brings it into native CSS and WebKit. Safari 16.4 is supporting that. So you can say something like, well, I'll just, one of the examples in this blog post is that you can say my root at the root level, I'm gonna define this CSS variable to be equivalent to green. And then later on, you can say, okay, well,I want in the LCH color space to compute a value, to compute a color from that green. And then what I want is I want the lightness in LCH to be half the value that it was in the color that I'm computing from, while the chroma and hue will stay the same. So that I'll give you green, except 50% darker. And there are a lot of different, like you can mix two colors together and you can specify which color space you want to do it in, which will affect how those two things are blended together. I think that's my favorite. How about yours?</blockquote></li>

Remains to be seen how useful it will actually be in its first go round because it can't do much beyond just serialize the thing. It can't do what a lot of people wanna do, just template and stamp out instances with slight differences and things like that. But it is really, really useful and handy nonetheless. So I'm excited about that. But the other one that I'm kind of tied with is the @property. So the reason that I am really excited about this is similarly complex and rooted in some history. So custom properties are a thing that I was excited about. They're like one of the things that I got really directly involved in discussing in CSS.

And a group of us suggested that they should be called what they are: they're just custom properties. And I think that those are brilliant and the things that people have been doing with them have just like blown my mind. But there's another piece of this that roughlyat the same time we had this like extensible web idea. And I pushed really hard for CSS to have something to do with that. And my argument was, look, the rest of the stack is hackable, right? Like the JavaScript, you can polyfill, like more or less, almost perfectly, right? And HTML has ways that you can extend it, lots of ways that you can extend it. There's an escape hatch on lots of these things where you don't have to reinvent the world if you want to do something very close to that. And CSS had none of that, right? If you want to polyfill something in CSS, good luck. If you have to parse the CSS because the CSSOM would throw things away, they wouldn't be in the CSSOM, so you couldn't use it to get them. And you don't have access to the downloaded CSS in some cases because it's like origin policy violation. It's really, really hard. And how do you hack it? How do you make cow paths in CSS? Like, so I was like, we need that. Like, I don't know what that is, but it seems like there's parts of that. And Houdini was the result of all that effort. And a lot of the things in Houdini have gone like focused on mostly not the things I care about, you know? And I'm like, well, you know, if somebody's willing to do that, then great. Like, let them do it, you know? Like,I'm totally happy to have the background, the paint, the paint one. Totally happy to have it. I just think that there's almost no actual use case for it that I've seen yet. But custom properties is a really good one. And a lot of the use cases, they want to have all of the real powers that a property has in CSS. They want to say like,I am inherited or I'm not inherited. Here is what my syntax is, right?

And the initial value is, let's say, zero pixels if it's a length. And then does this thing inherit or not? So you really, yet, now it's not just a substitute, which is what we've been using custom properties for, right? Just to substitute a value. Sort of, we've been using them as variables. Now it's really build your own property and define what kind of values it can accept and what its initial value is and whether or not it inherits down the chain and so on and so on and so on.</blockquote></li>

And the ones that don't, they won't get any worse experience than they used to. And then, yeah, so I was really happy to see that. They got a bunch of APIs that they've added, OffscreenCanvas, which I know you.</blockquote></li>

It is actually a really good thing to spend money on as it turns out, because while you don't use it, um, it is one of those lower level APIs that people build other things around and then you use it. So maybe your charting library uses it or maybe your mapping library use it or your games library use it and you don't even know that. You don't have to know that. And maps are like incredibly useful. I use them almost every day. And they're all rendered on canvas. And when Apple introduced the canvas, it was all on the main thread because there was only the main thread. And well, that's an awful lot of work to do on the main thread. So this is tricky because it's not the thing that everybody's going to ask for. It's another one of those, if you ask what everybody wants, they all want faster horses. But when we improve OffscreenCanvas, we can improve maybe a dozen libraries to use OffscreenCanvas. And then for every user of the web, something that they use probably every day suddenly gets more responsive and faster as users. It's really good for users. That's especially true on lower end devices.So awesome. So happy that that's the best. It's a good investment in the web platform.</blockquote></li>

There's a, in the Web Inspector toolbar, there's a icon that you can select and it creates a popover that lets you, at least at the moment, switch between color schemes like light and dark,that sort of light mode, dark mode kind of thing, whether reduced motion is on or off, whether increased contrast is on or off. And since it's a popover, there's room to grow there. They could put in things like,what media you wanna toggle into or any numbers of other things.

So they've added new stuff and better information when you click on those little badges in Safari. So like if there's an event box showing that, you know,your element has an event attached to it.

Let me go see if I can find the right function that triggers that and then I can set a break point there. No, this will show you what line the function is on. And from what I can tell, you can click through. Like if you click it, it'll say, well, in the example, they have function grouping-rules.html colon 73, and it's underlined. So I think if you click on that, it will jump you to line 73 of that source. So you're right at that function. But you don't even have to go there to set the breakpoint. Because like you say, in that popover, there's a little breakpoint and a little checkbox that's not enabled by default. But if you just click on it, then you've set a breakpoint and you didn't have to go digging somewhere else. And that, yeah, like you say, you see it...

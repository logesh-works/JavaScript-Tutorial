                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Yeah. And the reason we invited Martin on is because Martin is working on Servo. And today, we're going to do one of two exciting shows. We're going to do sort of back to back in this whole series on web ecosystem health. We had two presentations, novel engine presentations at the Web Engines Hackfest. We're going to talk about those today. Well, we're going to talk about Servo specifically today. One of the things that I think is really interesting to tie into this is that several times over the course of these nine episodes that we had before, we've made reference to the fact that the three major engines are tens of thousands of person years invested into cumulatively into them and how much they cost to maintain. And it means that you're way more likely to lose contenders than to gain them unless it's by evolution, somehow, by forking them.

                  <blockquote><cite>Martin Robinson</cite>: Yeah. Well, Servo is an experimental web browser engine that was created out of Mozilla research in around 2012. And it's got a lot of novel features. The main thing, I guess, historically that's important is that Servo is sort of a co-project with Rust. In that moment, Rust was quite new and Servo was a way of trying Rust out and feeding back into the Rust development process. And it also used a lot of Rust's novel features in an effort to make the web better. For instance, Rust has type safety much more than a language like C++. So it can guarantee through the type system memory safety. And also, because of the way the type system works, it's also much easier to do things in parallel across different threads in a way that you can make guarantees about the safety as a memory involved. So Rust has that type safety, and Servo also uses Rust's ability to spread things over different threads to implement support for laying out a webpage in parallel, which is something that no other web browser does even today, except in very minor cases.</blockquote></li>

For instance, we use something called Rayon to spread work across threads. But all of these build on top of Rust type system, which allows using different primitives like structs and data structures in a way where you can be sure that you aren't losing them or leaking them or writing into memory that doesn't exist anymore, that sort of thing.</blockquote></li>

So there were a lot of things that weren't, let's say, fully baked going on. But some things were very productive when they're being made and it was clear that they were an excellent idea and could potentially represent a huge speed-up to the way that Firefox worked at the time.For instance, one of those would be the style system, which in Servo, was written in a way that it was completely parallel as well. So before, in a browser like Gecko, if you wanted to style the page, you had to do it serially and not spread the work over different cores whereas Rust allow you to do it in parallel. And that also goes for things like selector matching. And those bits of Servo that were really successful, let's say style and then also this part called Web Render, which is a rasterization engine for web content were essentially bolted on to Gecko. And that became the source of development for those parts of Servo. And they're still there today. And it's one of the reasons why Quantum was a lot faster when it came out in addition to some other non-Servo related things, I believe like Electrolysis and Compositor thread.</blockquote></li>

In an open source project, you can have contributors, but you really need really good community management to make that work. And Servo, from its conception, had really great community management. I think those two things, community management and lots of excitement about the project is really what drives contributions. Because even if you have the excitement and you're not managing that excitement properly, there can be a lot of people who just get frustrated and leave, they'll go work in some other open source project. But if you manage the community well and you're able to shepherd contributions in and make it so that people feel like they're actually doing something interesting and contributing code, then it builds up sort of this snowball effect of community contributions.

And then, to me, there's a question of, 'Well, boy, I want to fund ... if I could give money to all these projects, should I give my money to Mozilla for Firefox, or should I give it to Servo for this?'And understanding that they're related in that way is I think really, really helpful.

That exists, I suppose, with any web engine in the sense that when you work on a web engine, you run into corners of the specification that aren't completely fleshed out yet. So in general, this is a thing that happens when you're implementing the web for the first time in an engine. You almost always run into bugs in spec or places where it's unclear what the spec means and you write a test and then gradually all the other engines come to an agreement about that test, even though the question started in the minor engine. And I think you're right that there's even more chance for, let's say, collaborative enhancement in engine like Servo just because it shares so much with Gecko.

But I mean it is an interesting point that coming to some of the specifications, excuse me, fresh and not having necessarily existing code to adapt, but code to implement in order to support a specification is a useful check on the clarity and correctness and completeness of specifications. So things like Servo or other new browser engines, minor engines, if we want to call them that, is a useful sort of, I shouldn't say unit test, but it's sort of like a test for those parts of the specifications. If someone comes in and they don't have 20-year-old or 30-year-old parsing code that they're just trying to graph new stuff onto, is this specification complete enough that you can implement and not run into questions or ambiguities or whatever?And it's interesting to hear that because people generally don't think about that, I think. They figure, 'Oh, well, browser engines, they just add new stuff.' But don't necessarily consider that they're adding stuff to code that's probably many, many staff turnovers before the person who's actually doing the implementation, they have this whole code base that they don't necessarily have complete intimate knowledge of.They have tests and rather than having to write the whole thing, rewrite the whole thing from scratch, they're adding a little bit.

And we've had bugs on the flexbox specification recently. But also, as someone who's worked mainly on implementing specifications that are a bit newer, it's interesting how much of CSS2 is just not specified still. There is a lot of, for instance, two things that we're working on now, which are big chunks of work are floating content and tables. And these are two parts of the CSS2 specification, which in general, floats are pretty good, but there's a lot of times where it's like, just do this to make it do that, in the specification where you have to make up what that means inside your engine. And then for tables, I think there's just no specification for how table layout is supposed to work top to bottom.</blockquote></li>

So, how come and Vadim and Bruce Lawson that the trick, they both were very mainstream, very, very competitive browsers. They said that basically they would have a bug line and open bugs and closed bugs. And the goal is to get those two to meet so all the open bugs are closed. And they said you could watch it with a grab over time and even if you had 100 people working on it, they would just continue to get it further and further apart because there is so much in web browsers that it has to work and it's still just not written down accurately. And I think a lot of that stuff is still probably some of the earlier stuff. No matter the fact that we have had so much focus on it, if nobody's building new engines, you're just going to hit a point where other engines have managed to reach really high degree of interoperability on those already and it's still not in the specs.

And this means that there was never a huge focus on making it ready to be a replacement for Gecko so much as a way to test out new ideas that could be used in Gecko. And it's only now that when we examine Servo and we decide to work on it, maybe we choose a different path where we want Servo to be more of a general purpose web engine. And there's a lot of work to do to get there and there's different phases of that work. For instance, you start out and you implement what the specification says. You start making web pages look better. But then, you begin to run into problems with things like correctness of the DOM APIs and making sure that events are delivered in the same order as you would expect other browsers to deliver them in. Even something as simple as when you resize an iframe, the events that bubble up from the resizing of that iframe happen in the right order, the mainframe, that kind of thing. And then even once you get to that point, even once the correctness is right, then you need to make a usable web engine, which means that it's performing and that there's no weird lag when you do things. And also that when you go to a page, things load and work when you click on them. And that phase is actually quite large as well. And then, even once you get to that phase, then you have to keep up with all of the new features that are added to the web.</blockquote></li>

Yeah, it's just about everything that you buy today is built on the web. When we had the show with Hulkam, he is on the board of print xml, which has a rendering engine that's used mainly for print. Amazon internally maintains several engines for stuff like that. I know there was also a WeasyPrint was another one.So, there's many, many, many applications for different parts of the web stack. And so, I think, the idea here is that we can make Servo very useful to segments of those and help build and grow it into more.

And Servo is not different in this respect. It has a little browser application, which essentially embeds the server web view as the main control. It has no UI outside of the browser itself. So currently, there's no way to, say, type a URL to go there, although we do have plans to implement something like that.

I don't know if I told this story before, but also related to the degree to which things were specified. One of the earliest things when I got involved in actually engaging in standards was a discussion in Ecma came out of that with the understanding that properties in JavaScript had, if you were to iterate over them, they would iterate in all engines in insertion order, almost without disagreement in everything that you could throw at it. But the spec said there is no order. And Java, at the time did, the same. Like it said, there's no order. But when Java decided to change that, people had to build and compile and test and they found out that things were broken because of that. But I think Opera or Chrome tried to change that for performance reasons. They found that if you don't have to maintain an insertion order, which the spec says you don't, then we can run faster. And doing so broke Gmail and a bunch of other major sites because they had learned to depend on that you can do that. And that doesn't mean you can't necessarily render Gmail. You probably could render it, but it just won't work.</blockquote></li>

But there's this whole layer of the DOM which sits, essentially all the implementation of the DOM sits on top of the JavaScript engine is implemented in native code. So in Servo, that's all implemented in Rust, whereas in Gecko it's implemented in C++. So we have to re-implement those as well. And then for Canvas, it's a special case too because not only is that a DOM API, but it actually is also a vector rasterization engine.

Whereas as far as a general purpose vector or rasterizer vector being like you have a path on your canvas and you're trying to rasterize it. That's a much harder task for a GPU to do.And Servo does have a GPU rasterizer for Canvas that it uses, but maybe it's not as fast as the CPU version in all the cases.

Layout NG learned a lot from Edge HTML with their attempt. There's work on better rendering engine stuff in WebKit as well.

                  <blockquote><cite>Martin Robinson</cite>: That's an interesting question. I think, if anything, the rest of the web browsers have become more similar to Servo as time has gone on. Servo sort of pioneered a lot of things that web browsers do by default now, such as display lists or always using the GPU to render content. In that sense, I think that there are opportunities for learning from other engines because I think they are more similar. And even when it comes down to something like Layout NG or some of the new layout work that's happening in WebKit that even the layout engines look more similar to Servo. Essentially, the fashion nowadays is something that Servo also does is when you implement layout, you implement it as close to the specification as possible. And even the data structures that you use in layout have the same name as what's talked about in the specifications. So there should be more or less a one-to-one mapping between concepts in the spec and in the code itself. So, I think, in that sense, there is this sensation of all of us being sort of on the same path. And we can look at the other engines and see what they're doing compared to Servo. And I mean maybe at some point the opposite will be true as well.</blockquote></li>

So I think it would be hard to make it so that Gecko would take from the server repository or some shared repository directly. But, I mean, we could probably imagine a future where there's just a lot of work on, say, the style crate from the outside, from both Servo and Gecko side or some other smaller crate. And maybe in that case, the work would happen in a shared repository or in Servo and then Gecko might pull those changes down when they want them. Yeah, I think it could go either way. As far as taking things from Servo and it might become parts of Gecko again, I think, it could really depend. I suspect that there are cases where Servo could be using a crate that Servo also has this constellation of crates that it uses, that it controls. And some of those are actually used by Gecko and the upstream is still outside the Gecko repository.

Now if you're running a new test for the web platform and it's not on the web platform tests, it's a kind of big red flag like, why isn't this there? And it just made the whole process of working on a web browser much easier because not only are the tests there, but they also represent some shared understanding of what each engine does. If they all pass a test and you don't, then you know that you're not in the consensus opinion about what should happen in this case.

One of the things that we didn't talk about here but is talked about in the talk that was at the Web Engines Hackfest that I would encourage people to go watch because it's just a great talk anyway, but there are two different layout modules. Do you want to talk about this because I find this really, really interesting.</blockquote></li>
                
                <li class="c-chat__item c-chat__item--3">
                  <blockquote><cite>Martin Robinson</cite>: Sure. There's two different layout modules. One is called Layout 2013, and one is called Layout 2020. And these are roughly analogous to the original layout in Link and Layout NG. Essentially, the old engine is more featureful and it supports a much wider swath of the web. But the new engine skews much more closely to the specification and should have support for properly fragmenting content. Fragmentation is this process of taking different parts of the layout tree and spreading them. For instance, when you have a line breaking, each line is a fragment of that particular node in the layout tree. And then, also, if you have multi-column or multi-page, you have to split the render node across different positions. And that's something that would have been very difficult with the old layout tree. So that part at least is similar to the things that other layout engines are doing, sorry, other web engines are doing. And then, also, we have made this change with regard to parallelization. When you're laying out the web, in general, things can be done in parallel, but there are moments where you have to do things in serial. Things like floats or CSS content, specifically CSS counters, can really make it so that certain things that you're laying out have to be done one after another. And then the old engine, it would try to do everything in parallel. And then when it couldn't, it would sort of drop down to this serial layout mode, which was kind of like the fallback mode. But in the new layout system, we've taken this approach where we know ahead of time that some things need to be done serially. So what we can do is as we're walking down the tree, we can do things in parallel till we get to that part that needs serial layout, lay that out serially. And even in the descendants of that serial layout, you can switch back to parallel layout. But then, also, when you come back up and finish the serial layout portion, you can keep laying the rest of the page out in parallel again. So it's like we're getting the benefits of parallelization, but we're not having to do this fallback mode where we lose it in case you use a float or use a CSS counter. Now, things should be as parallel as possible when they can. And this engine we're switching to, we're basically trying to finish off the basics of CSS2 and essentially remove, at a certain point, we'll be able to remove the old one. And the hope is that, in general, it'll be more performant and also much more spec compliant.</blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Martin Robinson</cite>: Yeah, for sure. So, at the top level, we have this idea of a, I guess, you'd say a web engine. And that's everything basically inside the web view. And that web engine would be embedded into a browser with Chrome and URL bars to control the web engine. Inside the web engine, there are different parts that do different things. And all of these parts kind of have interrelation between the other pieces. On one hand, you have a network stack, and that's the thing that's going to be communicating with a socket to get all the data from the network. And then, maybe after that, you have a parser, HTML parser, which takes the data from the socket and turns it into DOM nodes. And these DOM nodes are essentially usually little data structures that are implemented in native code. And they have essentially a representation into the JavaScript, which is all managed by this JavaScript engine. So, this is what's running the script. And every time you touch the DOM, it's going back across the boundary of the JavaScript engine into these DOM nodes, which are in native code. All that said, you also have style and when the style is parsed by the parser, again, it's combined with the DOM nodes return in the native code. And it's given to something called the layout engine, which essentially takes these DOM nodes plus style and turns them into a tree of what are called render objects or layout objects. And this is a tree that's very similar to the DOM but isn't exactly the same. And once you have all those nodes in the layout tree, then you can pass that to the next phase, which is the rendering phase. And typically, that involves something like creating a display list and then passing that display list to a rasterizer, which turns those descriptions of onscreen elements into pixels on your screen. So I'd say those are the main parts of a web engine.</blockquote></li>

And in Servo, it's just going to be a lot less work than in other layout engine because there's just less code and there's less people.

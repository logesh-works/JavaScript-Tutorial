I think in early 2022, that scenario changed in that I was sponsored by Netlify specifically to work on 11ty full time. So 11ty graduated from a side project to my full-time job. Working on 11ty was my full-time job. So yeah, it was awesome. And then probably a month or two ago, that scenario changed. And yeah, it's back as a side project again.

And you build as many things as you can in that time that you're given. But I think looking back on the things that I built, I wonder if I built some things that maybe were not as sustainable and things that were maybe more of an attention play or trying to get more market share rather than things that were long-term sustainable. Because I think I kind of knew going into it that if your open-source project is fully funded, it isn't necessarily the most secure financial position to be in terms of company support. I think that if your project is not necessarily directly tied to a company's bottom line, and that way you almost become the most expendable when the market gets rough. I mean, that isn't even necessarily a bad reflection on Netlify either. It's just times change and business priorities change.

I think that, I don't know, some of the things that I've been thinking about as this situation for 11ty changed was how would the scenario have been different if I had talked to investors when they wanted to talk to me a few years ago? And I sort of wanted to keep 11ty as an independent thing that didn't have a lot of external roadmap or a lot of tight coupling to business cases that were maybe tied to things that I wasn't interested in. Or maybe going down roads that would've burned me out much quicker. I think that just burnout is, I feel like, tied very closely to having to work on things that you don't want to work on. And I've really tried to organize 11ty in such a way that I don't have to make hard decisions in that space at least. So yeah, I think that just on the flip side of that coin is that I think that will probably retire a few 11ty plugins that we developed last year that don't have the desire from the original maintainer, namely me, to work on them. And we put out a survey for folks to participate and tell us what plugins they wanted to see continue forward.

And so it becomes this very awkward conversation of am I going to work on Netlify things as an open-source project even though I am employed by Netlify, but they aren't paying me to work on this stuff specifically? So it almost becomes a monetary conversation with Netlify to say, 'Hey, if my current employer wants these integrations to continue existing and they have customers that are using these integrations, then we need to figure something else out,' which I think is just kind of an awkward thing to talk about. </blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Zach Leatherman</cite>:  Yeah. I don't know if I know the best way to bifurcate the projects that are doing well on Open Collective and on ones that aren't. I would say that 11ty is doing well in that we have a lot of individual contributors donating to the project, which I think will be good as we enter our next phase of not having full-time sponsorship. We can then leverage that money to pay for contributions to the project, which I think is good. And it's a little awkward, because in some respects, I feel like if a project has full-time maintenance, it almost hurts its ability to have individual contributor donations come in. I mean, to me, a similar parallel is when you think about climate change in a way, that all of these super mega corporations are doing most of the polluting. But all of the marketing you hear around it is that we need everyone to do their fair share when it's really like 10 companies are doing the lion's share of the pollution. And it's almost a same reflection in the open-source monetization space. Everyone's saying, 'Oh, if we could just chip in $5 a month, then we can fund this project if we get enough people.' But just as someone that's done the math on that, $5 a month is not enough. Even when you have hundreds of contributors, $5 is not enough for a full-time salary, and there's a bunch of other variables that go into that. I'm a staff engineer. I'm fairly well along in my career. If I were at the beginning of my career, it might be easier to fund a full-time salary. I think the other thing that ties into it is where folks live. If your cost of living is New York City in the United States, it becomes a completely different thing. But I think the other sort of weird aspect of that that I've been thinking about a lot is just living in the United States generally, there's a higher cost of living associated with that. I got to pay for my own insurance if I don't have an employer. I have to pay for health insurance, which is very expensive in the US. So in some ways, it feels like if I lived in a country that had, I don't know, more options for health insurance to pay for it, that it would make it easier to transition to a community-funded salary for 11ty. But that is what it is. </blockquote></li>

So I mean, in my mind, that answers the question that you need to be coupled to a business. You need to have some sort of business or monetization strategy around your open-source project, otherwise it won't succeed. I feel like the other maybe interesting piece of this is that there's this maybe feeling of meritocracy. And meritocracy is what decides what projects are successful. I do not think that that is true. I don't think that could be any further from the truth. I think the things that you hear about in the projects that are successful are just really tied to the business case around them and how much money they have behind them and how much economic momentum they've built up. So yeah, I don't know. I have learned a lot about just open-source maintenance in general. And sort of opened my eyes in a way to just sustainability, generally speaking, I don't think that most projects will not be able to be successful from small Open Collective donations.

The reason folks have heard about 11ty is because, in many respects, it was in the right place at the right time. And we had a lot of luck that went into that, because it did just start as just a thing to scratch my own itch. And it scratched, I guess, similar itches in other people at the same time. And it was really as the complexity in front end had started to get away from a lot of projects. So I mean, it's just hard to have awareness of both sides of the thing and try to try and keep your perspective in a way that doesn't make you cynical moving forward. I feel like the number one emotion that I battle in my day-to-day life is just cynicism. And I'm just really trying to not end up in a cynical place.

They're actually separate code bases, but they're just very, very similar. So who is going to invest in this project is largely a subset of who sees the value in it. It's tricky. You got to tap into a really huge audience to see the value in your thing to get any real money. So 11ty has done honestly pretty well. I look at the Open Collective. But you're right.

So we think about this a lot for the web engines. Currently, we have this model where we have three. And they all have a steward, but the stewards are two really, really giant companies. Different kinds of companies too. They're very different kinds of companies, and a foundation. And the foundation kind of gets all of its money from one of those companies. So other people do contribute. And it's important that the other people contribute it. We see great things when that happens. But it's not enough. I mean, there's still hundreds of proposals and improvements and things that are just sitting there, even some old ones. We want to get really good print support, but who's investing in that, for example? We want to keep MathML going. That's actually a great example. Igalia worked on MathML, and we worked from multiple funding sources, including an Open Collective. We got two big individual donations from MathML, 1 for $50,000 and 1 for $25,000.

And so it's this very difficult tension between these two groups where we want everything to be open, we want everything to be approachable, but we also want to make money from it in a way that's sustainable.

I would like to see the same stipend and folks to argue for the same stipend for open-source donations because that money is not nothing. It's somewhat expensive to buy a conference ticket. And so even if folks were able to use their existing stipend to donate to open-source projects, I feel like it would be a huge boon to the sustainability story.

                  <blockquote><cite>Eric Meyer</cite>: So, Baseline is essentially a way of letting you look at let's say, information about a Web API and it will tell you whether the thing is widely supported, or not widely supported, or not supported at all, I guess, in some cases. And the way they're defining widely supported is that it's supported in three major browser engines for at least the last two major release versions, which is a little complicated. So if something's been supported in Chromium since version 79, and Gecko since version 79, and then WebKit added it two release versions ago, two major release versions ago, then it's countered as widely supported.Or if WebKit has supported it since 2016, and Chromium has supported it for the last three releases, and Gecko has added it two releases ago then that would also be widely supported. So if you go to MDN, Mozilla Developers Network, and you land on a property like margin-top, it's going to tell you if that's widely supported. I really hope that margin-top is widely supported. But then it might for things like new color formats, it might have different information. So I mean, that's what Baseline is meant to do, is to give people, to give developers a more coarse-grained idea of, 'Hey, can I use this thing right now or not?'</blockquote></li>

So, in 2019 Igalia was, there's a effort spearheaded by little Dan, Dan Ehrenberg.</blockquote></li>

So it was to bring together different interest groups about JavaScript, who some people are involved because they make frameworks and some people make tools. And we want to get together and talk with them and help review and shape what's developing in standards so that it takes all those things into account. And there was one that was set up for educators. And we had a lot of trouble like, 'What do you want this group to do?'Because the obvious thing is documentation in education. We could give talks. We could write MDN. There's so many things that seem obvious, but a non-obvious aspiration that we had is that, 'Boy, there's a lot of it already.' And it starts at a very early stage. We start talking about things sometimes years before anybody can really use them in good conscience. You know what I mean?</blockquote></li>

And the national news would come from one of the three major networks, like ABC, NBC, CBS. And the news anchor would for half an hour give you little bite-sized summaries of what the top news stories were, like hitting up the homepage of a news site today and glancing through the headlines and everything. Anyway it's... And people actually used to schedule their evenings around it, because that was how they caught up with the news, with what was going on that day.

To get it past that point, you have to do a whole bunch of stuff and it takes a long time. I just see a lot of convergence of ideas here.

It's been a while in the works.  It sort of short circuits that or bypasses that whole step of, 'Oh, this sounds cool. Let me adapt the example in this page to my project. And then I'll load it up in the web browser and then it doesn't work.' And then you spend however long trying to figure out, 'Did I get the syntax wrong? Am I not understanding what kind of elements will accept it? Am I not thinking through this other thing? Is it just the browser that I tested in? Let me open another browser.'Ideally, you can skip that whole step with this Baseline information and say, 'Scroll snapping! Scroll snapping would be perfect for this carousel that marketing insists that I implement. Let me go read up on that.' And then you land on the scroll snap page and it will tell you right away if this is going to help you or not. As opposed to maybe you land there. I mean, Scroll Snap's pretty widely supported, if I remember correctly. But let's just imagine that it's only supported in one of three browser engines. Somebody lands there and immediately can see, 'Oh, this CSS is not going to work. I'm probably going to have to go to JavaScript,' as opposed to today they would land on it, land on that page, and it would say, 'Widely supported,' and be like, 'Awesome, I can do this with CSS.' Or HTML or whatever the thing is.And this is supposed to apply to more than CSS. It's supposed to be throughout, I think, the HTML and certainly the JavaScript APIs.~~ So you could land on an API page and see right away 'Oh gosh, this actually works in all browsers and it has for at least two major versions,' which I thought was... What do you think about that last two major versions cut off for marking something as being supported?</blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Anything we choose here is going to be arbitrary. I think one of the things that you get from the two major versions thing is first you miss the bugs that are inevitably probably in the first one. But second, there are a non-small number of browsers as well that are built off of Chrome especially, and they sometimes can lag. So it probably increases your likelihood that it's going to be also in downstream browsers if you say two versions. Also, not everybody gets the version at the same time. Even though we say, 'Oh, today Chrome 109...' Well, the world is a big place and there are a few billion people who are getting Chrome. So when will they get it can depend on all kinds of things, including even many of them say, 'Hey, we have an update. Click here to restart.' And do you?And also, in the things that it can delay is internets, where your corporate IT lags you on that, which is actually a lot of internet traffic and intranet work. So I can tell you, I worked for a company before I came here, for a long time that had controlled tech IT policies and would delay your rollout. And it would be very, very confusing if you weren't aware of that, because you would say, 'Gee, but the latest version is this and it tells me there's no update available.' So I think that the two major versions is just guaranteeing that you're not going to get a lot of weird, false like, 'This should be supported, and I can't understand why it's not working for this small fraction of my users.' So I think it's a good one.I think that the Baseline itself is going to move slow. I mean, when they talked about in, there's a WebDev piece about this. And there's also her talk introducing it. It's a short 15 minutes, I think. By the way, did you watch it?</blockquote></li>

And also, working with Igalia, if other engines are happy to include them, but for whatever reason can't find the resources to bring up the Baseline. And they're talking about also announcing what will be in the Baseline. So thinking about it, it is actually, as she explained, related also to Interop. So there will be Interop 2023 and there will be Baseline 2024. And these are just nice, simple-to-grok things we can work on together and understand the same way together.And I think some people will think it's a little too slow, but that's some people. That is really, really important to remember, because you might hear development discussion for sometimes years before there's any implementations. And long lag and then once it's real, nobody knows about it. It will go into all of our release notes and the moment will be missed for the vast majority of people, because there's just so much noise. And so a number of people will only discover this maybe years from now. At least currently that's the case. And that's kind of one of the things I believe that Baseline is intended to help.Because while it might feel slow to you, if we tell everybody, if we spend a year saying, 'This is Baseline 2023,' more people will get it and be able to focus and learn it and push it out into the world in real life, faster.

Developers a lot have a long experience of hear about cool thing, wherever they hear about it, CSS Tricks, or Smashing Magazine, or Twitter, or Macedon or whatever. And go try it out and discover that it doesn't work as fully, or as cleanly, or as widely as they would like. And then file it in the, 'Oh, that was a cool idea, but it doesn't work right now. I'll check back in five years,' bin of their head. And maybe they do, maybe they don't check back in a few years. Because that's sort of been the experience, this, 'Oh, cool new CSS thing that just landed in Safari'? I was like, 'Oh, cool. Let me go check that out. And now I want to see in the other brothers. Oh, it doesn't work there, 'cause only Safari, or Firefox, or whoever was first.An example that's immediately coming to my mind, because I was just dealing with a design the other day where I really wanted this is the WebKit has supported the hanging punctuation CSS property since 2016. They're the only one. And we don't have to get into the details of what it does. It helps text line up more nicely if there are lines of texts that start with punctuation. But at any rate, that's been, it's 2023, it's seven years that it's been available, and working, and improving web rendering in WebKit browsers and Safari and other WebKit browsers. And it's not present Chromium or Gecko. And so there's this bit set in the back of my head when it comes to hanging punctuation.That's the, 'Oh, I can do this, but I have to remember that it only works in one of the three main browser engines, and hopefully, someday maybe it will become more widely supported.' And for something like hanging punctuation, that's not a big deal. But if it were something like Grid, if Grid had been like that, and Flexbox kind of was like that for a while, where it was like, 'Oh, I can use this in this browser, but the thing that I did is rendered completely differently in other browsers.' And it took a few years for that to get worked out. And so people have this idea in their head of, 'Oh yeah, cool thing, but I need to check back in later to see if it's actually widely supported.'And ideally, I mean, hopefully, Baseline will keep people from having to keep doing that, sort of set a mental note for themselves to check back. Or unfortunately, I think more often it's like, 'Oh yeah, cool idea, but it doesn't work.' And they just immediately file it under does not work and never update that knowledge.</blockquote></li>

That may be the eventual outcome, but as we are having this conversation, as an example, if you go to scroll-margin-top, there's no Baseline information for that on MDN. But if you go to the pages for the various Grid properties, there is a little Baseline banner, literally the page title grid. And right below it, 'Baseline widely supported in this particular case.' That's for the grid property.If you do the grid area property, or the grid row property, or the grid row start property, any of those, in those property pages, you'll get a little Baseline banner right at the top of the page. And then at the bottom, you still have that support table that is on every page of MDN, or nearly every page of MDN. So same thing for all the flex properties, they have the Baseline information. So it is limited at this time in terms of what parts of MDN it's on. But you could go today and see what the experiences is and what it does for you. I do hope that this gets onto all the pages sooner rather than later, because there will be those use cases where someone might say, 'Well, okay, it's not widely supported, but it's supported for my use case.'One of the things about Baseline as it stands right now, it does not make the fact that it's two major release versions ago clear in that little banner. So somebody who's familiar with what the Baseline project is and how it's structured, just knows that. But somebody who just lands on an MDN page never having heard of Baseline and sees a little banner, it's like, 'Oh, wow!' But it doesn't say, 'At least the last two versions,' or, 'Since October 2021,' or anything like that. And maybe will in the future. This is not necessarily a done project that is carved in stone. It's absolutely, I think, there are plans for figuring out how is it received as it is now? How could it be improved? What needs to be changed? All that stuff will be figured out.

You need some arbitrary thing to really even give people a way to bring all their complaints, and criticisms, and ideas together. So it is a coarse grain, but pretty good, rather simple to articulate way to do it, I guess. But other things track real usage stats, like can I use it has the thing in the upper right-hand corner that's like, 'This represents 98.2% of browsers worldwide,' or something like that. You've seen that, right?</blockquote></li>

Because that's all just self-reported and UA strings and you know how much we lie about UA strings and how easy it is to get confused about them. And basically, the thing that we tell everybody don't do, that is what we're relying on for this data. It's very, very hard to know, what is actually the share of Samsung internet out there? We don't really have a way to know that. We have some approximations that are basically based on the UA string, except that sometimes if Samsung Internet were to tell you the truth, you would cause it to break. So even sometimes Samsung Internet is like, 'Just kidding. I'm grown.' The list of sites to lie to is not infinitely big.</blockquote></li>

Even worse, for ones that are under the covers, they're the same, but you don't know. They resell, effectively. It's a website's package and it gets very, very hard to know who to reach. They're unresponsive, because they've sort of outsourced their website, really. So there's not always a person you can reach out to. But in the meantime, everybody's going to complain, so they'll lie. And those are the sites really. Those sites are going to be included every time. You know what I mean?The things that we estimate usage on are estimated from looking at the HP requests to lots and lots and lots of websites. And then it's extrapolated from there. But the set of websites is which ones are popularly loaded. And in the grand scheme of things, our websites are not destinations.</blockquote></li>

The chapter that I wrote last year for the Web Almanac specifically stated that it was kind of trying to do this. It was trying to say, 'Look, if you read one thing every year, make it this chapter because we'll tell you what became really interoperable this year. And if you just pay attention to those things, you are going to get a lot out of that.'And it will protect you from exactly the kind of things that we talked about before, where it was like, 'Oh, I tried that five years ago and it didn't work. How am I supposed to know when it got fixed?' This chapter will tell you. The same thing with this baseline. I think it's just a really, really good idea. I'm really, really pleased to see it. I'm glad that Google suggested it in the WebDX Group, and I'm glad that we picked it up and ran with it.</blockquote></li>

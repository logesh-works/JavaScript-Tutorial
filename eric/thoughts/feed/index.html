					<description><![CDATA[Last week, I designed a logo for the podcast I do at Igalia.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I’ve been doing at <a href="https://igalia.com">Igalia</a> of late is podcasting with Brian Kardell.  It’s called “<a href="https://www.igalia.com/24-7/chats">Igalia Chats</a>”, and last week, I designed it a logo.  I tried out a number of different ideas, ran them past the Communication team for feedback, and settled on this one.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/igalia-chats-logo.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/igalia-chats-logo.jpg" alt="The Igalia Chats logo, which combines the official full Igalia logo of a many-colored circle and the name of the company with the word “Chats” below the logo in a slightly larger font size than that used for the name of the company.  Next to them is a large stylized icon of a microphone." /></a>
  <figcaption>D&amp;AD Awards committee, you know where to find me.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And there you have it, the first logo I’ve designed in… well, in quite a while.  My work this time around was informed by a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Podcast apps, sites, etc.  expect a square image for the podcast’s logo.  This doesn’t mean you have to make the visible part of it square, exactly, but it does mean any wide-and-short logo will simultaneously feel cramped and lost in a vast void.  Or maybe just very far away.  The version shown in this post is <em>not</em> the square version, because this is not a podcast app and because I could.  The square version just adds more empty whitespace at the top and bottom, anyway.</li>
<li>I couldn’t really alter the official logo in any major way: the brand guidelines are pretty strong and shouldn’t be broken without collective approval.  Given the time that would take, I decided to just work with the logo as-is, and think about possible variants (say, the microphone icon in the blank diamond of the logo) in a later stage.  I did think about just not using the official logo at all, but that felt like it would end up looking too generic.  Besides, we hav e a pretty nifty logo there, so why not use it?</li>
<li>A typeface for the word “Chats” that works well with Igalia’s official logo.  I used <a href="https://www.stormtype.com/families/etelka">Etelka</a>, which is a font we already use on the web site, and I think is the basis of the semi-serifed letters in the official logo anyway.  Though I could be wrong about that; while I definitely have opinions about typefaces these days, I’m not very good at identifying them, or being able to distinguish between two similar fonts.  Call it typeface blindness.</li>
<li>Using open-source resources where possible; thus, the microphone icon came from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a>.  I then modified it a bit (rounded the linecaps, shortened the pickup’s brace) to balance its visual weight with the rest of the design, and not crowd the letters too much.  I also added a subtle vertical gradient to the icon, which helped the word “Chats” to stand out a little more.  Gotta make the logo pop, donchaknow?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably some adjustments I’ll make after a bit of time, but I was determined not to let perfect be the enemy of shipping.  As for how I came to create the logo, you’re probably thinking fancy CSS Grid layout and custom fonts and all that jazz, but no, I just dumped everything into <a href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> and fiddled with ideas until I had some I liked.  It’s not a fantastic environment for this sort of work, I expect, but it’s Good Enough For Me™.</p>

<p>So, if you’re subscribed to <a href="https://www.igalia.com/24-7/chats">Igalia Chats</a> via your listening channel of choice, you should be seeing a new logo.  If you <em>aren’t</em> subscribed… try us, won’t you?  Brian and I talk about a lot of web-related stuff with a lot of really interesting people &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;most recently, with <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/polypane">Kilian Valkhof about the web development application Polypane</a>, with <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/undersea"> Stephen Shankland about undersea data cables</a>, with <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/zach"> Zach Leatherman about open-source work and funding</a>, and many more.  Plus sometimes we just talk with each other about what’s new in Web land, things <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/baseline"> like Google Baseline</a> or <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/safari-16">huge WebKit updates</a>.  And, yes, sometimes we talk about what Igalia is up to, like <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/servo"> our work on the Servo engine</a> or <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/steam-powered-open-source">the Steam Deck</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of the things I quite enjoy about working for Igalia&#160;&#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;the way I can draw upon all the things I’ve learned over my many (many) years to create different things.  A logo last week, a thumbnail-building tool the week before, writing news posts, recording podcasts, doing audio production, figuring out transcription technology, and on and on and on.  It can sometimes be frustrating in the way all work can be, but it rarely gets boring. (And if that sounds good to you, <a href="https://www.igalia.com/jobs/open/">we are hiring</a> for a number of roles!)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Web browsers have higher performance requirements than video games, and in essentially the same ways.  Seriously.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve played a lot of video games over the years, and the thing that just utterly blows my mind about them is how every frame is painted from scratch.  So in a game running at 30 frames per second, everything in the scene has to be calculated and drawn every 33 milliseconds, no matter how little or much has changed from one frame to the next.  In modern games, users generally demand 60 frames per second.  So everything you see on-screen gets calculated, placed, colored, textured, shaded, and what-have-you in 16 milliseconds (or less).  And then, in the next 16 milliseconds (or less), it has to be done <em>all over again</em>.  And there are games that render the entire scene in single-digits numbers of milliseconds!</p>

<p>I mean, I’ve done some simple 3D render coding in my day.  I’ve done hobbyist video game development; see <a href="https://gravitywars.meyerweb.com/">Gravity Wars</a>, for example (which I really do need to get back to and make less user-hostile).  So you’d think I’d be used to this concept, but somehow, I just never get there.  My pre-DOS-era brain rebels at the idea that everything has to be recalculated from scratch every frame, and doubly so that such a thing can be done in such infinitesimal slivers of time.</p>

<p>So you can imagine how I feel about the fact that <em>web browsers</em> operate in exactly the same way, and with the same performance requirements.</p>

<p>Maybe this shouldn’t come as a surprise.  After all, we have user interactions and embedded videos and resizable windows and page scrolling and stuff like that, never mind CSS animations and DOM manipulation, so the viewport often needs to be re-rendered to reflect the current state of things.  And to make all that feel smooth like butter, browser engines have to be able to display web pages at a minimum of 60 frames per second.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/‎fps.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/‎fps.jpg" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>Admittedly, this would be a popular UI for browsing social media.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This demand touches absolutely <em>everything</em>, and shapes the evolution of web technologies in ways I don’t think we fully appreciate.  You want to add a new selector type?  It has to be performant.  This is what blocked <code>:has()</code> (and similar proposals) for such a long time.  It wasn’t difficult to figure out how to select ancestor elements&#x202F;—&#x2009;it was very difficult to figure out how to do it really, really fast, so as not to lower typical rendering speed below that magic 60fps.  The same logic applies to new features like view transitions, or new filter functions, or element exclusions, or whatever you might dream up.  No matter how cool the idea, if it bogs rendering down too much, it’s a non-starter.</p>

<p>I should note that none of this is to say it’s impossible to get a browser below 60fps: pile on enough computationally expensive operations and you’ll still jank like crazy.  It’s more that the goal is to keep any new feature from dragging rendering performance down too far in reasonable situations, both alone and in combination with already-existing features.  What constitutes “down too far” and “reasonable situations” is honestly a little opaque, but that’s a conversation slash vigorous debate for another time.</p>

<p>I’m sure the people who’ve worked on browser engines have fascinating stories about what they do internally to safeguard rendering speed, and ideas they’ve had to spike because they were performance killers.  I would love to hear those stories, if any BigCo devrel teams are looking for podcast ideas, or would like to guest on <a href="https://igalia.com/24-7/chats">Igalia Chats</a>. (We’d love to have you on!)</p>

<p>Anyway, the point I’m making is that performance isn’t just a matter of low asset sizes and script tuning and server efficiency.  It’s also a question of the engine’s ability to redraw the contents of the viewport, no matter what changes for whatever reason, with reasonable anticipation of things that might affect the rendering, every 15 milliseconds, over and over and over and over and over again, just so we can scroll our web pages smoothly.  It’s kind of bananas, and yet, it also makes sense.  Welcome to the web.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A year or so ago, I set about listening through my entire music library alphabetically by song title.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other week I crossed a midpoint, of sorts: as I was driving home from a weekly commitment, my iPhone segued from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxwRzW6ehAU">Rush’s “Mystic Rhythms”</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXJBS1Up_kg">The Seatbelts’ “N.Y.  Rush”</a>, which is, lexicographically speaking, the middle of my iTu&#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;oh <em> excuse</em> me, the middle of my Music Dot App Library, where I passed from the “M” songs into the “N” songs.</p>

<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Troubadour.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Troubadour.jpg" alt="" class="pic" /></a>

<p>See, about a year or so ago, I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.kevinsmokler.com/" rel="acquaintance met">Kevin Smokler</a> to set about listening through my entire music library alphabetically by song title.  Thus, I started with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfXtcvmkiw">“ABC’s” by K’naan</a> and will end, probably in a year or so, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgVTmt6t3hg">“9999999” by Mike Morasky (a.k.a Aperture Science Psychoacoustics Laboratory)</a>.</p>

<p>Every time I have to drive my car for more than a few minutes, I’ll plug in my iPhone and continue the listen from where I left off.  This mainly happens during the aforementioned weekly commitment, which usually sees me driving for an hour or so.  I also listen to it while I’m doing chores around the house like installing ceiling fans or diagnosing half-dead Christmas light strings.</p>

<p>This sort of listen is, in many ways, like listening to the entire library on shuffle, because, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Spool">Jared Spool</a> used to point out (and probably still does), alphabetically sorting a long list of things is indistinguishable from having it randomized.  For me, the main difference between alphabetical and random is that it’s a lot easier to pick back up where you left off when working through alphabetically. (Yes, Music Dot App should do that automatically, but sometimes it forgets where it was.) You can also be a lot more certain that every song gets a listen, something that’s harder to ensure if you’re listening to a random shuffle of a couple thousand tracks and your software loses its place.</p>

<p>There are other advantages: sometimes, artists will use the same song title, and you get interesting combinations.  For example, there was “America”, which gave me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cTC6rGE9jo">a song by K’naan</a> and then a same-titled, but <em>very</em> different, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4BmaBNDmgQ">song by Spinal Tap</a>.  Similarly, there are titular combinations that pop out, like  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0t0e1npyYM">“Come On” by The Goo Goo Dolls</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LiUG0Chubg">“Come On In, The Dreams Are Fine” by Dee-Lite</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En4szIQL9Yo">“Come On Over” by Elana Stone</a>.</p>

<p>Some of these combinations groove, some delight, some earn the stank face, and some make me literally laugh out loud.  And some aren’t related by title but still go together really, really well.  A recent example was the segue from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzVjZu4fl4o">The Prodigy’s “Narayan”</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfQD1QiQ9o4">Radiohead’s “The National Anthem”</a>, which sonically flowed <em> just right</em> at the switchover, almost like they’d been composed to have that effect.  It made this old <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/yfo/">long-ago radio DJ</a> smile.</p>

<p>I say I took inspiration from Kevin because my listen has a couple of differences to his:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kevin has a “no skips, ever” rule, but I will skip songs that are repeats.  This happens a lot when you have both live and studio albums, as I do for a few artists (particularly 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)">Rush</a>), or have copied tracks for lightly-engineered playlists, as I have a few times.  That said, if I have a song by one artist and a cover of that song by another, I don’t skip either of them.  For remixes or alternate recordings of a song by the same artist, I generally don’t skip, unless the remix is just the original song with a vaguely different beat track.</li>
<li>I filtered out most of my classical content before starting.  This is not because I dislike classical, but because they tend to sort together in unrelenting clumps &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;all of Beethoven’s and Mozart’s symphonies one after another after another, for example &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;and I wanted a varietal mix.  I did keep “classical” albums like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carreras_Domingo_Pavarotti_in_Concert"><cite>Carreras Domingo Pavarotti in Concert</cite></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana_(Orff)"><cite>Carmina Burana</cite></a> because they have normal-length tracks with titles that scatter them throughout the sort.  The same reasoning was used to retain classic film and TV scores, even if I was stretching it a bit to leave in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage#LP_and_cassette"><cite>The Music of Cosmos</cite></a> (the 1980 one), which prefixes all its tracks with Roman numerals…&#160;but each track is a medley, so it got a pass.  The whole-album-in-a-single-MP3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmos#Soundtrack"><cite>The Music of Osmos</cite></a>, on the other hand, did not.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Portal-2_-Songs-to-Test-By.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Portal-2_-Songs-to-Test-By.jpg" alt="" class="pic" /></a>

<p>All that said, I have a much shorter road than Kevin: he has a library of over twelve <em>thousand</em> tracks, whereas my slightly-filtered library is just shy of 2,500 tracks, or right around 160 hours.  The repeated-song skips knock the total time down a bit, probably by a few hours but not much more than that.  So, figure at an average of 80 minutes per week, that’s about 120 weeks, or two years and four months to get from beginning to end.</p>

<p>And what will I do when I reach the end?  Probably go back to better curate the sorting (e.g., configuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU4L6THYAbM">Soundgarden’s “4th of July”</a> to be sorted as “Fourth of July”), create a playlist that cuts out the repeats ahead of time, and start over.  But we’ll see when I get there.  Maybe next time I’ll listen to it in reverse alphabetical order instead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a bit over a month now on my new 14” MacBook Pro, and I have complaints.  Not about the hardware, which is solid yet lightweight, super-quiet yet incredibly fast and powerful, long-lived on battery, and decent enough under the fingertips.  Plus, all the keyboard keys Just Work<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, unlike the MBP it replaced!  So that’s nice.</p>

<p>No, my complaints are entirely about the user environment.  At first I thought this was because I skipped directly from OS X 10.14 to macOS 13, and simply wasn’t used to How The Kids Do Things These Days®, but <a href="https://me.dm/@stop/109989005813215592">apparently I would’ve felt the same</a> even if I’d kept current with OS updates.  So I’m going to gripe here in hopes someone who knows more than me will have recommendations to ameliorate my annoyance.</p>

<h3 id="dragthing-dismay">DragThing Dismay</h3>

<p>This isn’t on Apple, but still, it’s a huge loss for me.  I know <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/02/23/a-leap-of-decades/">I already complained about the lack of DragThing</a>, but I really, really do miss what it did for me.  You never know what you’ve got ’til it’s gone, right?  But let me be clear about exactly what it did for me, which so far as I can tell no macOS application does, nor does macOS itself.</p>

<p>The way I used DragThing was to have a long shelf down the right side of my monitor containing small-but-recognizable icons representing my most-used folders (home directory, Downloads, Documents, Applications, a few other folders) and a number of applications.  It stayed there all the time, and the icons were always there whether or not the application was running.</p>

<p>When I launched, say, Firefox, then there would be a little indicator next to its application icon in DragThing to indicate it was running.  When I quit Firefox, the indicator went away but the Firefox icon stayed.  And also, if I launched an application that wasn’t in the DragThing shelf, it did <em>not</em> add an icon for that application to the shelf. (I used the Dock at the bottom of the screen to show me that.)</p>

<p>There are super-powered application switchers available for macOS, but as far as I’ve seen, they only list the applications actually running.  Launch an application, its icon is added.  Quit an application, its icon disappears.  None of these switchers let me keep persistent static one-click shortcuts to launch a variety of applications and open commonly-used folders.</p>

<h3 id="dock-folder-disgruntlement">Dock Folder Disgruntlement</h3>

<p>Now I’m on to macOS itself.  Given the previous problem, the Dock is the only thing available to me, and I have gripes about it.  One of the bigger ones is rooted in folders kept on the Dock, to the right of the bar that divides them from the application icons.  When I click on them, I get a popup (wince) or a Stack (shudder) instead of them just opening the target folder in the Finder.</p>

<p>In the Before Times, I could create an alias to the folder and drop that in the Dock, the icon in the Dock would look like the target folder, and clicking on the alias opened the folder’s window.  If I do that now, the click-to-open part works, but the aliases all look like blank text documents with tiny arrows.  What the hell?</p>

<p>If I instead add actual folders (not aliases) to the Dock, holding down ⌥⌘ (option-command) when I click them does exactly what I want.  Only, I don’t want to have to hold down modifier keys, especially when using the trackpad.  I’ve mostly adapted to the key combo, but even on desktop I still sometimes click a folder and blink in irritation at the popup thingy for a second before remembering that things are stupider now.</p>

<h3 id="translucency-tribulation">Translucency Tribulation</h3>

<p>The other problem with the Dock is that mine is too opaque.  That’s because the nearly-transparent Finder menu bar was really not doing it for me, so acting on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cbirdsong/109915043135251483">a helpful tip</a>, I went and checked the “Reduce Transparency” option in the Accessibility settings.  That fixed the menu bar nicely, but it also made the Dock opaque, which I didn’t actually want.  I can pretty easily live with it, but I do wish I could make just the menu bar opaque (without having to resort to desktop wallpaper hacks, which I suspect do not do well with changes of display resolution).</p>

<h3 id="shortcut-stupidity">Shortcut Stupidity</h3>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/shortcut-stupidity.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/shortcut-stupidity.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>Seriously, Apple, what the hell.</figcaption>

<p>And while I’m on the subject of the menu bar: no matter the application or even the Finder itself, dropdown menus from the menu bar render the actions you can do in black and the actions you can’t do in washed-out gray.  Cool.  But also, <em>all</em> the keyboard shortcuts are now a washed-out gray, which I keep instinctively thinking means they’ve been disabled or something.  They’re also a lot more difficult for my older eyes to pick out, and I have to flick my eyes back and forth to make sure a given keyboard shortcut corresponds to a thing I actually can do.  Seriously, Apple, what the <em>hell</em>?</p>

<h3 id="trash-can-troubles">Trash Can Troubles</h3>

<p>I used to have the Trash can on the desktop, down in the lower right corner, and now I guess I can’t.  I vaguely recall this is something DragThing made possible, so maybe that’s another reason to gripe about the lack of it, but it’s still bananas to me that the Trash can is not there by default.  I understand that I may be very old.</p>

<h3 id="preview-problems">Preview Problems</h3>

<p>On my old machine, Preview was probably the most rock-solid application on there.  On the new machine, Preview occasionally hangs on closing heavily-commented PDFs when I choose not to save changes.  I can force-quit it and so far haven’t experienced any data corruption, but it’s still annoying.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those are the things that have stood out the most to me about Ventura.  How about you?  What bothers you about your operating system (whichever one that is) and how would you like to see it fixed?</p>

<p>Oh, and I’ll follow this up soon with a post about what I like in Ventura, because it’s not all frowns and grumbles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two videos I was using <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper</a> on have been published, so you can see for yourself how the captioning worked out.  Designed as trade-show booth reel pieces, they’re below three minutes each, so watching both should take less than ten minutes, even with pauses to scrutinize specific bits of captioning.</p>

</figure>

<p>As I noted in <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/03/23/peerless-whisper/">my previous post about this</a>, I only had to make one text correction to the second video, plus a quick find-and-replace to turn “WPE WebKit” into “WPEWebKit”.  For the first video, I did make a couple of edits beyond fixing transcription errors; specifically, I added the dashes and line breaking in this part of the final SubRip Subtitle (SRT) file uploaded to YouTube:</p>

<pre><code>00:00:25,000 --&gt; 00:00:32,000
- Hey tell me, is Michael coming out?
- Affirmative, Mike's coming out.</code>
</pre>

<p>This small snippet actually embodies the two things where Whisper falls down a bit: multiple voices, and caption line lengths.</p>

<p>Right now, Whisper doesn’t even try to distinguish between different voices, the technical term for which is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_diarisation">speaker diarisation</a>”.  This means Whisper ideal for transcribing, say, a conference talk or a single-narrator video.  It’s lot less useful for things like podcasts, because while it will probably get (nearly) all the words right, it won’t even throw in a marker that the voice changed, let alone try to tell which bits belong to a given voice.  You have to go into the output and add those yourself, which for an hourlong podcast could be… quite the task.</p>

<p>There are requests for adding this to Whisper scattered in their GitHub discussions, but I didn’t see any open pull requests or mention of it in the README, so I don’t know if that’s coming or not.  If you do, please <a href="#comments">leave a comment</a>!</p>

<p>As for the length of captions, I agree <a href="https://universeodon.com/@jdeisenberg/110072878523949450">with J David Eisenberg</a>: Whisper too frequently errs on the side of “too long”.  For example, here’s one of the bits Whisper output:</p>

<pre><code>00:01:45,000 --&gt; 00:01:56,000
Here is the dash.js player using MSE, running in a page, and using Widevine DRM to decrypt and play rights-managed video with EME, all fluidly.</code>
</pre>

<p>That’s eleven seconds of static subtitling, with 143 characters of line length.  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/subtitles/#Line-length">The BBC recommends</a> line lengths at or below 37 characters, and <a href="https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/215274938-What-is-the-maximum-number-of-characters-per-line-allowed-in-Timed-Text-assets-">Netflix suggests a limit</a> of 42 characters, with actual hard limits for a few languages.  You can throw in line breaks to reduce line length, but should never have more than three lines, which wouldn’t be possible with 143 characters.  But let’s be real, that 11-second caption really should be split in twain, at the absolute minimum.</p>

<p>Whisper does not, as of yet, have a way to request limiting caption lengths, either in time or in text.  There is <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/314">a fairly detailed discussion</a> of this over on Whisper’s repository, with some code graciously shared by people working to address this, but it would be a lot better if Whisper accepted an argument to limit the length of any given bit of output.  And also if it threw in line breaks on its own, say around 40 characters in English, even when not requested.</p>

<p>The last thing I’d like to see improved is speed.  It’s not terribly slow as is, to be clear.  Using the default model size (small), which is what I used for the videos I wrote about, Whisper worked at about 2:1 speed: a two-minute video took about a minute to process.  I tried the next size up, the medium model, and it worked at roughly 1:1.5 speed, taking about an hour fifteen to process a 46-minute video.</p>

<p>The thing is, all that is running solely on the CPU, which in my case is a 12-core M2.  According to <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper/pull/382">this pull request</a>, problems in one of Whisper’s dependencies, PyTorch, means GPU utilization is essentially unavailable on the hardware I have. (Thanks to Chris Adams for the pointer.) I expect that will be cleared up sooner or later, so the limitation feels minor.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s a powerful tool, with accuracy I still find astounding, only coming up short in quality-of-life features that aren’t critical in some applications (transcribing a talk) or relatively easily worked around in others (hand-correcting caption length in short videos; using a small script to insert line breaks in longer videos).  The lack of speaker diarisation is the real letdown for me, and definitely the hardest to work around, so I hope it gets addressed soon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I ran OpenAI’s Whisper on my laptop to transcribe some videos, and it did an astonishingly good job.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happened was, I was hanging out in an online chatter channel when a little birdy named <a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/" rel="friend colleague met">Bruce</a> chirped about <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">OpenAI’s Whisper</a> and how he was using it to transcribe audio.  And I thought, <em>Hey, I have audio that needs to be transcribed.</em>  Brucie Bird also mentioned it would output text, SRT, and WebVTT formats, and I thought, <em>Hey, I have videos I’ll need to upload with transcription to YouTube!</em>  And <strong>then</strong> he said you could run it from the command line, and I thought, <em>Hey, <strong>I</strong> have a command line!</em></p>

<p>So off I went to install it and try it out, and immediately ran smack into some hurdles I thought I’d document here in case someone else has similar problems.  All of this took place on <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/02/23/a-leap-of-decades/">my M2 MacBook Pro</a>, though I believe most of the below should be relevant to anyone trying to do this at the command line.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was what the GitHub repository’s README recommended, which is:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ pip install -U openai-whisper</code>
</pre>

<p>That failed because I didn’t have <code>pip</code> installed.  Okay, fair enough.  I figured out how to install that, setting up an alias of <code>python</code> for <code>python3</code> along the way, and then tried again.  This time, the install started and then bombed out:</p>

<pre><code>Collecting openai-whisper
  Using cached openai-whisper-20230314.tar.gz (792 kB)
  Installing build dependencies ...  done
  Getting requirements to build wheel ...  done
  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ...  done
Collecting numba
  Using cached numba-0.56.4.tar.gz (2.4 MB)
  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ...  error
  error: subprocess-exited-with-error</code>
</pre>

<p>…followed by some stack trace stuff, none of which was really useful until ten or so lines down, where I found:</p>

<pre><code>RuntimeError: Cannot install on Python version 3.11.2; only versions &gt;=3.7,&lt;3.11 are supported.</code>
</pre>

<p>In other words, the version of Python I have installed is <em>too modern</em> to run AI.  What a world.</p>

<p>I DuckDucked around a bit and hit upon <code>pyenv</code>, which is I guess a way of installing and running older versions of Python without having to overwrite whatever version(s) you already have.  I’ll skip over the error part of my trial-and-error process and give you the commands that made it all work:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ brew install pyenv

$ pyenv install 3.10

$ PATH="~/.pyenv/shims:${PATH}"

$ pyenv local 3.10

$ pip install -U openai-whisper</code>
</pre>

<p>That got Whisper to install.  It didn’t take very long.</p>

<p>At that point, I wondered what I’d have to configure to transcribe something, and the answer turned out to be precisely zilch.  Once the install was done, I dropped into the directory containing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBdefloUvso">my MP4 video</a>, and typed this:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ whisper wpe-mse-eme-v2.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>Here’s what I got back.  I’ve marked the very few errors.</p>

<pre>
[00:00.000 --&gt; 00:07.000]  In this video, we'll show you several demos showcasing multi-media capabilities in WPE<mark> </mark>WebKit,
[00:07.000 --&gt; 00:11.000]  the official port of the WebKit engine for embedded devices.
[00:11.000 --&gt; 00:18.000]  Each of these demos are running on the low-powered Raspberry Pi 3 seen in the lower right-hand side of the screen here.
[00:18.000 --&gt; 00:25.000]  Infotainment systems and media players often need to consume digital rights-managed videos.
[00:25.000 --&gt; 00:32.000]  <mark>They</mark> tell me, is Michael coming out?  Affirmative, Mike's coming out.
[00:32.000 --&gt; 00:45.000]  Here you can see just that, smooth streaming playback using encrypted media extensions, or EME, with PlayReady 4.
[00:45.000 --&gt; 00:52.000]  Media source extensions, or MSE, are used by many players for greater control over playback.
[00:52.000 --&gt; 01:00.000]  YouTube TV has a whole conformance test suite for this, which WPE has been passing since 2021.
[01:00.000 --&gt; 01:09.000]  The <mark>loan</mark> exceptions here are those tests requiring hardware support not available on the Raspberry Pi 4, but available for other platforms.
[01:09.000 --&gt; 01:16.000]  YouTube TV has a conformance test for EME, which WPE<mark> </mark>WebKit passes with flying colors.
[01:22.000 --&gt; 01:40.000]  Music
[01:40.000 --&gt; 01:45.000]  Finally, perhaps most impressively, we can put all these things together.
[01:45.000 --&gt; 01:56.000]  Here is the dash.js player using MSE, running in a page, and using Widevine DRM to decrypt and play rights-managed video with EME all fluidly.
[01:56.000 --&gt; 02:04.000]  <mark>Music</mark>
[02:04.000 --&gt; 02:09.000]  Remember, all of this is being played back on the same low-powered Raspberry Pi 3.
[02:27.000 --&gt; 02:34.000]  For more about WPE WebKit, please visit WPE<mark> </mark>WebKit.com.

<p>I am, frankly, astonished.  This has <em>no business</em> being as accurate as it is, for all kinds of reasons.  There’s a lot of jargon and very specific terminology in there, and Whisper nailed pretty much every last bit of it, first time in, no special configuration, nothing.  I didn’t even bump up the model size from the default of <code>small</code>.  I felt a little like that Froyo guy in the animated Hunchback of Notre Dame meme yelling about sorcery or whatever.</p>

<p>True, the output isn’t absolutely perfect.  Let’s review the glitches in reverse order.  The last two errors, turning “Igalia” into “EGALIA”, seems fair enough given I didn’t specify that there would be languages other than English involved.  I routinely have to spell it for my fellow Americans, so no reason to think a codebase could do any better.</p>

<p>The space inserted into “WPEWebKit” (which happens throughout) is similarly understandable.  I’m impressed it understood “WebKit” at all, never mind that it was properly capitalized and not-spaced.</p>

<p>The place where it says <code>Music</code> and I marked it as an error: This is essentially an echoing countdown and then a white-noise roar from rocket engines.  There’s a “music today is just noise” joke in here somewhere, but I’m too hip to find it.</p>

<p>Whisper turning “lone” into “loan” doesn’t particularly faze me, given the difficulty of handling soundalike words.  Hell, just yesterday, I was scribing a conference call and mistakenly recorded “gamut” as “gamma”, and those aren’t even technically homophones.  They just sound like they are.</p>

<p>Rounding out the glitch tour, “Hey” got turned into “They”, which (given the audio quality of that particular part of the video) is still pretty good.</p>

<p>There is one other error I couldn’t mark because there’s nothing to mark, but if you scrutinize the timeline, you’ll see a gap from 02:09.000 and 02:27.000.  In there, a short clip from a movie plays, and there’s a brief dialogue between two characters in not-very-Dutch-accented English there.  It’s definitely louder and more clear than the 00:25.000 –&gt; 00:32.000 bit, so I’m not sure why Whisper just skipped over it.  Manually transcribing that part isn’t a big deal, but it’s odd to see it perform so flawlessly on every other piece of speech and then drop this completely on the floor.</p>

<p>Before posting, I decided to give Whisper another go, this time on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbW1J7huASY">a different video</a>:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ whisper wpe-gamepad-support-v3.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>This was the result, with the one actual error marked:</p>

<pre>[00:00.000 --&gt; 00:13.760]  In this video, we demonstrate WPE WebKit's support for the W3C's GamePad API.
[00:13.760 --&gt; 00:20.080]  Here we're running WPE WebKit on a Raspberry Pi 4, but any device that will run WPE WebKit
[00:20.080 --&gt; 00:22.960]  can benefit from this support.
[00:22.960 --&gt; 00:28.560]  The GamePad API provides a JavaScript interface that makes it possible for developers to access
[00:28.560 --&gt; 00:35.600]  and respond to signals from GamePads and other game controllers in a simple, consistent way.
[00:35.600 --&gt; 00:40.320]  Having connected a standard Xbox controller, we boot up the Raspberry Pi with a customized
[00:40.320 --&gt; 00:43.040]  <mark>build route</mark> image.
[00:43.040 --&gt; 00:48.560]  Once the device is booted, we run cog, which is a small, single window launcher made specifically
[00:48.560 --&gt; 00:51.080]  for WPE WebKit.
[00:51.080 --&gt; 00:57.360]  The window cog creates can be full screen, which is what we're doing here.
[00:57.360 --&gt; 01:01.800]  The game is loaded from a website that hosts a version of the classic video arcade game
[01:01.800 --&gt; 01:05.480]  Asteroids.
[01:05.480 --&gt; 01:11.240]  Once the game has loaded, the Xbox controller is used to start the game and control the spaceship.
[01:11.240 --&gt; 01:17.040]  All the GamePad inputs are handled by the JavaScript GamePad API.
[01:17.040 --&gt; 01:22.560]  This GamePad support is now possible thanks to work done by Igalia in 2022 and is available
[01:22.560 --&gt; 01:27.160]  to anyone who uses WPE WebKit on their embedded device.
[01:27.160 --&gt; 01:32.000]  For more about WPE WebKit, please visit wpewebkit.com.
[01:32.000 --&gt; 01:35.840]  For more information about Igalia, or to find out how we can help with your embedded device
[01:35.840 --&gt; 01:39.000]  needs, please visit us at Igalia.com.  </pre>

<p>That should have been “buildroot”.  Again, an entirely reasonable error.  I’ve made at least an order of magnitude more typos writing this post than Whisper has in transcribing these videos.  And <em>this</em> time, it got the spelling of Igalia correct.  I didn’t make any changes between the two runs.  It just… figured it out.</p>

<p>I don’t have a lot to say about this other than, wow.  Just <em>WOW</em>.  This is some real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Clarke’s Third Law</a> stuff right here, and the <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003/02/13/the-nature-of-progress/">technovertigo</a> is Marianas deep.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The process of trading up from a 2013 laptop to a 2023 laptop, including some potentially useful bits about cleanly updating Homebrew.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve heard it said there are two kinds of tech power users: the ones who constantly update to stay on the bleeding edge, and the ones who update only when absolutely forced to do so.  I’m in the latter camp.  If a program, setup, or piece of hardware works for me, I stick by it like it’s the last raft off a sinking island.</p>

<p>And so it has been for my early 2013 MacBook Pro, which has served me incredibly well across all those years and many continents, but was sliding into the software update chasm: some applications, and for that matter its operating system, could no longer be run on its hardware.  Oh and also, the top row of letter keys was becoming unresponsive, in particular the E-R-T sequence.  Which I kind of need if I’m going to be writing English text, never mind reloading pages and opening new browser tabs.</p>

<h3 id="stepping-up">Stepping Up</h3>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So on Monday, I dropped by the Apple Store and picked up a custom-built early 2023 MacBook Pro: M2 Max with 38 GPU cores, 64GB RAM, and 2TB SSD.  (Thus quadrupling the active memory and nearly trebling the storage capacity of its predecessor.)  I went with that balance, or perhaps imbalance, because I intend to have this machine last me another ten years, and in that time, RAM is more likely to be in demand than SSD.  If I’m wrong about that, I can always plug in an external SSD.  Many thanks to the many people in <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb">my Mastodon herd</a> who nudged me in that direction.</p>

<p>I chose the 14” model over the 16”, so it is a wee bit smaller than my old 15” workhorse.  The thing that surprises me is the new machine looks boxier, somehow.  Probably it’s that the corners of the case are not nearly as rounded as the 2013 model, and I think the thickness ratio of display to body is closer to 1:1 than before.  It isn’t a problem or anything, it’s just a thing that I notice.  I’ll probably forget about it soon enough.</p>

<p>Some things I find mildly-to-moderately annoying:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dragthing.com/index.html">DragThing</a> doesn’t work any more.  It had stopped being updated before the 64-bit revolution, never mind the shift to Apple silicon, so this was expected, but <em>wow</em> do I miss it.  Like a stick-shift driver uselessly stomping the floorboards and blindly grasping air while driving an automatic car, I still flip the mouse pointer toward the right edge of the screen, where I kept my DragThing dock, before remembering it’s gone.  I’ve looked at alternatives, but none of them seem like they’re meant as straight up replacements, so I’ve yet to commit to one.  Maybe some day I’ll ask <a href="https://www.dimsumthinking.com/">Daniel</a> to teach me Swift to I can build my own. (Because I <em>definitely</em> need more demands on my time.)</li>
<li>The twisty arrows in the Finder to open and close folders don’t have enough visual weight.  Really, the overall UI feels like a movie’s toy representation of an operating system, not an actual operating system.  I mean, the visual presentation of the OS looks like something I would create, and brother, that is <em>not</em> a compliment.</li>
<li>The Finder’s menu bar has no visually distinct background.  What the hell.  No, seriously, what the hell?  The Notch I’m actually okay with, but removing the distinction between the active area of the menu bar and the inert rest of the desktop seems… ill-advised.  Do not like.  <strong>HARK, A FIX:</strong> <a href="https://birdsong.dev/">Cory Birdsong</a> pointed me to “System Settings… > Accessibility > Display > Reduce Transparency”, which fixes this, <a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@cbirdsong/109915043135251483"{>over on Mastodon</a>.  Thanks, Cory!</li>
<li>I’m not used to the system default font(s) yet, which I imagine will come with time, but still catches me here and there.</li>
<li>The alert and other systems sounds are different, and I don’t like them.  Sosumi.</li>

</ul>

<p>Oh, and it’s weird to me that the Apple logo on the back of the display doesn’t glow.  Not annoying, just weird.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I’m happy with it so far.  Great display, great battery life, and the keyboard works!</p>

<h3 id="getting-migratory">Getting Migratory</h3>

<p>The 2013 MBP was backed up nightly to a 1TB Samsung SSD, so that was how I managed the migration: plugged the SSD into the new MBP and let Migration Assistant do its thing.  This got me 90% of the way there, really.  The remaining 10% is what I’ll talk about in a bit, in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar situation.</p>

<p>The only major hardware hurdle I hit was that my <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/dell-ultrasharp-u2713hm">Dell U2713HM monitor</a>, also of mid-2010s vintage, seems to limit HDMI signals to 1920×1080 despite supposedly supporting HDMI 1.4, which caught me by surprise.  When connected to a machine via DisplayPort, even my 2013 MBP, the Dell will go up to 2560×1440.  The new MBP only has one HDMI port and three USB-C ports.  Fortunately, the USB-C ports can be used as DisplayPorts, so I acquired a DisplayPort–to–USB-C cable and that fixed the situation right up.</p>

<p>Yes, I could upgrade to a monitor that supports USB-C directly, but the Dell is a good size for my work environment, it still looks pretty good, and did I mention I’m the cling-tightly-to-what-works kind of user?</p>

<p>Otherwise, in the hardware space, I’ll have to figure out how I want to manage connecting all the USB-A devices I have (podcasting microphone, wireless headset, desktop speaker, secondary HD camera, etc., etc.) to the USB-C ports.  I expected that to be the case, just as I expected some applications would no longer work.  I expect an adapter cable or two will be necessary, at least for a while.</p>

<h3 id="trouble-brewing">Trouble Brewing</h3>

<p>I said earlier that Migration Assistant got me 90% of the way to being switched over.  Were I someone who doesn’t install stuff via the Terminal, I suspect it would have been 100% successful, but I’m not, so it wasn’t.  As with the cables, I anticipated this would happen.  What I didn’t expect was that covering that last 10% would take me only an hour or so of actual work, most of it spent waiting on downloads and installs.</p>

<p>First, the serious and quite unexpected problem: my version of <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> used an old installation prefix, one that could break newer packages.  So, I needed to migrate Homebrew itself from <code>/usr/local</code> to <code>/opt/homebrew</code>.  Some searching around indicated that the best way to do this was uninstall Homebrew entirely, then install it fresh.</p>

<p>Okay, except that would <em>also</em> remove everything I’d installed with Homebrew.  Which was maybe not as much as some of y’all, but it was still a fair number of fairly essential packages.  When I ran <kbd>brew list</kbd>, I got over a hundred packages, of which most were dependencies.  What I found through further searching was that <kbd>brew leaves</kbd> returns a list of the packages I’d installed, without their dependencies.  Here’s what I got:</p>

<pre style="columns: 3;">
automake
bash
bison
chruby
ckan
cmake
composer
ffmpeg
gh
git
git-lfs
httpd
imagemagick
libksba
lynx
minetest
minimal-racket
pandoc
php
php@7.2
python@3.10
ruby
ruby-install
wget
yarn
</pre>

<p>That felt a lot more manageable.  After a bit more research, boiled down to its essentials, the New Brew Shuffle I came up with was:</p>

<pre class="bash">

<code>$ brew leaves &gt; brewlist.txt

$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"

$ xcode-select --install

$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

$ xargs brew install &lt; brewlist.txt</code>

</pre>

<p>The above does elide a few things.  In step two, the Homebrew uninstall script identified a bunch of directories that it couldn’t remove, and would have to be deleted manually.  I saved all that to a text file (thanks to <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a>’s “Copy output” feature) for later study, and pressed onward.  I probably also had to <code>sudo</code> some of those steps; I no longer remember.</p>

<p>In addition to all the above, I elected to delete a few of the packages in <code>brewlist.txt</code> before I fed it back to <code>brew install</code> in the last step&#x202F;—&#x2009;things like <code>ckan</code>, left over from my <a href="https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal Space Program</a> days &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;and to remove the version dependencies for PHP and Python.  Overall, the process was pretty smooth.  I just had to sit there and watch Homrebrew chew through all the installs, including all the dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h3>

<p>Once all the reinstalls from the last step had finished, I was left with a few things to clean up.  For example, Python didn’t seem to have installed.  Eventually I realized it had actually installed as <code>python3</code> instead of just plain <code>python</code>, so that was mostly fine and I’m sure there’s a way to alias one to the other that I might get around to looking up one day.</p>

<p>Ruby also didn’t seem to reinstall cleanly: there was a library it was looking for that complained about the chip architecture, and attempts to overcome that spawned even more errors, and none of them were decipherable to me or my searches.  Multiple attempts at uninstalling and then reinstalling Ruby through a variety of means, some with Homebrew, some other ways, either got me the same indecipherable erros or a whole new set of indecipherable errors.  In the end, I just uninstalled Ruby, as I don’t actually use it for anything I’m aware of, and the default Ruby that comes with macOS is still there.  If I run into some script I need for work that requires something more, I’ll revisit this, probably with many muttered imprecations.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>httpd</code> wasn’t working as intended.  I could launch it with 
<kbd>brew services httpd start</kbd>, but the resulting server was pointing to a page that just said “It works!”, and not bringing up any of my local hosts.  Eventually, I found where Homebrew had stuffed <code>httpd</code> and its various files, and then replaced its configuration files with my old configuration files.  Then I went through the cycle of typing <kbd>sudo apachectl start</kbd>, addressing the errors it threw over directories or PHP installs or whatever by editing <code>httpd.conf</code>, and then trying again.</p>

<p>After only three or four rounds of that, everything was up and running as intended &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;and as a bonus, I was able to mark <code>httpd</code> as a Login item in the Finder’s System Settings, so it will automatically come back up whenever I reboot!  Which my old machine wouldn’t do, for some reason I never got around to figuring out.</p>

<p>Now I just need to decide what to call this thing.  The old MBP was “CoCo”, as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer">TRS-80 Color Computer</a>, meant as a wry commentary on the feel of the keyboard and a callback to the first home computer I ever used.  That joke still works, but I’m thinking the new machine will be “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a>” in honor of the first actually powerful home computer I ever used and its 64 kilobytes of RAM.  There’s a pleasing echo between that and the 64 gigabytes of RAM I now have at my literal fingertips, four decades later.</p>

<p>Now that I’m up to date on hardware and operating system, I’d be interested to hear what y’all recommend for good quality-of-life improvement applications or configuration changes.  Link me up!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What I wish for in an MP3 player so I can create richer, more professional-sounding playlists.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I published <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/02/08/css-wish-list-2023/">a CSS Wish List</a>, which reminded me I have another wish list rattling around in my head, and I’d like to throw out into the world.  This one is for an MP3 player in the vein of WinAmp or Apple Music, but with slightly more DJ-like capabilities in its playlists.</p>

<p>To wit:</p>

<ul>

<li>The ability to set the playback volume for a track <em>in a playlist</em>.  Right now, if I adjust the playback volume of a track to match the others on a playlist, I’m changing its volume in every context.  Let’s say I bump up the volume setting on Yes’s “Leave It” so it matches Army of Anyone’s “Leave It”.  Now, if I go back to play <cite>90215</cite>, which is the Yes album containing their “Leave It”, that one track will be <em>way</em> louder than the rest of the album.  This is honestly ridiculous, and it ought to be easy to fix.  Just let me say “on this playlist, play this track at this volume”.  And no, I don’t want some automagic “volume stabilizer” to try to do it for me, because they’re never quite right.  They’re the autocorrect of autotuning.</li>

<li>The ability to define, to the millisecond, how much two successive tracks in a playlist overlap.  This is useful when trying to mix two songs so the beat of one plays off against the beat of the other, so you get a smoothly bumpin’ segue.  Ideally, you would do this by click/tap-dragging waveform visualizations of the two tracks, in order to be able to match up (or offset) the beat-peaks, and quickly play just the overlap (maybe with a few extra seconds to either side).</li>

<li>The ability to trim tracks in a playlist.  This is closely related to the previous wish, but here, you could trim off the silent bit at the beginning or end of a track when it’s played in the playlist you’re building.  When it’s in the context of its source album, the silences are left intact.  This could also be used to trim off actual sound, in case you wanted to start a verse in or something, but the primary use case would be saying “for this track in this playlist, skip the half-second of silence”.  Again, being able to work with waveform visualizers would help here.</li>

<li>The ability to define the duration of fade-ins and fade-outs for each track in a playlist.  Maybe, paired with the previous wish for overlap duration, I want to be able to fade one song out and the next song in during the overlap period.  Or maybe for only part of the overlap, or for longer than the period of overlap, or even when there is no overlap.  I know you can set crossfade durations in apps like Apple’s Music, but they’re global and that’s not okay.  Sometimes you want to say “no crossfades on this playlist except for these two segues, one of which is 5 seconds long and the other of which is 2.7 seconds”.</li>

<li>The ability to play back these playlists on my mobile device (iPhone, Android phone, whatever).  On desktop too, sure, but the primary use case here is on mobile: a carefully-made woodshop playlist, or a workout playlist, or whatever.</li>

<li>If I’m <em>really</em> dreaming, I’d also like to have this supported by all music apps, so I could port playlists from one app to another.  Having all this supported in some kind of streaming service, so I could allow other people to listen to my playlists with relatively ease, would be even more incredible.</li>

</ul>

<p>To reiterate: those would all be things applied <em>on a per-playlist basis</em>.  The tracks would sound within their source albums as they were produced to sound, but could be audibly modified for playlist purposes in a non-destructive way.</p>

<p>I’ve occasionally done stuff like this in Audacity, which works okay, but it does mean I have to import all the tracks, decide where to set the track break during overlaps, and then render them into new tracks, essentially creating copies of the songs with new waveforms and maybe parts of other songs mixed in at the beginning or end.</p>

<p>That all seems wasteful when this stuff could probably be expressed using simple strings of text within a playlist file.  I mean, the UI for the playlist editing could be all graphical and cool and Audacity-like (or better), but the actual data could be represented in just a few bytes of text.  And maybe this is all possible in an application like Logic Pro&#x202F;—&#x2009;I wouldn’t know, having never used it&#x202F;—&#x2009;but it shouldn’t require a $300 piece of software to make these things possible.</p>

<p>Maybe this is something that would only appeal to old farts like me, them what made mixtapes when they were created using a dual-deck player using actual magnetic tapes.  But I bet some of the young’uns would find it fun and interesting as well.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In which I set out to write down a wish or two for CSS in 2023, and ended up with a list of sixt—no, wait, seventeen.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/01/css-wishlist-2023/">Dave
asked people to share their CSS wish lists for 2023</a>, and even though
it’s well into the second month of the year, I’m going to sprint
wild-eyed out of the brush along the road, grab the hitch on the back of
the departing bandwagon, and try to claw my way aboard. 
At first I thought I had maybe four or five things to put on my list,
but as I worked on it, I kept thinking of one more thing and one more
thing until eventually I had a list of (checks notes) sixt&#x202F;—&#x2009;no, <em>SEVENTEEN?!?!?</em>  What the hell.</p>

<p>There’s going to be some overlap with the things being worked on for
<a href="https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023">Interop 2023</a>, and I’m sure
there will be overlap with other peoples’ lists.  Regardless, here we
go.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="subgrid">Subgrid</h3>

<p>Back in the day, I asserted <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/15/subgrids-considered-essential/">Grid should wait for subgrid</a>.  I was
probably wrong about that, but I wasn’t wrong about the usefulness of
and need for subgrid.  Nearly every time I implement a design, I trip
over the lack of widespread support.</p>

<p>I have a blog post in my head about how I hacked around this problem
for <a href="https://wpewebkit.org">wpewebkit.org</a> by applying the
same grid column template to nested containers, and how I could make it
marginally more efficient with variables.  I keep not writing it, because
it would show the approach and improvement and then mostly be about the
limitations, flaws, and annoyances this approach embodies.  The whole 
idea just depresses me, and I would probably become impolitic.</p>

<p>So instead I’ll just say that I hope those browser engines that have
yet to catch up with subgrid support will do so in 2023.</p>

<h3 id="masonry-layout">Masonry layout</h3>

<p>Grid layout is great, and you can use it to create a masonry-style
layout, but having a real <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Masonry_Layout">masonry layout</a> mechanism would be better,
particularly if you can set it on a per-axis basis.  What I mean is, you
could define a bunch of fixed (or flexible) columns and then say the
rows use <code>masonry</code> layout.  It’s not something I’m likely to
use myself, but I always think the more layout possibilities there are,
the better.</p>

<h3 id="grid-track-styles">Grid track styles</h3>

<p>For someone who doesn’t do a ton of layout, I find myself wanting to
style grid lines a surprising amount.  I just want to do something
like:</p>

<pre><code>display: grid;
gap: 1em;
grid-rules-columns: 1px dotted red;</code></pre>

<p>…although it would be much better to be able to style separators for
a specific grid track, or even an individual grid cell, as well as be 
able to apply it to an entire grid all at once.</p>

<p>No, I don’t know exactly how this should work.  I’m an idea guy!  But
that’s what I want.  I want to be able to define what separator lines
look like between grid tracks, centered on the grid lines.</p>

<h3 id="anchored-positioning">Anchored positioning</h3>

<p>I’ve wanted this in one form or another almost since CSS2 was
published.  The general idea is, you can position an element in relation
to the edges of another element that isn’t a containing block.  I wrote
about this a bit in <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/10/19/a-dashing-navbar-solution/">my post on connector lines for wpewebkit.org</a>, but
another place it would have come in handy was with <a
href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/09/12/nuclear-footnotes/">the
footnotes on <cite>The Effects of Nuclear Weapons</cite></a>.</p>

<p>See, I wanted those to actually be <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#sidenotes">sidenotes, Tufteee-styleee</a>.  Right now, in order to make sidenotes, you have to stick the footnote into the text, right where its footnote reference appears &#x202F;—&#x2009; or, at a minimum, right after the element containing the footnote reference.  Neither was acceptable to me, because it would dork up the source text.</p>

<p>What I <em>wanted</em> to be able to do was collect all the footnotes as
endnotes at the end of the markup (which we did) and then absolutely
position each to sit next to the element that referenced them, or
have it pop up there on click, tap, hover, whatever.  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-anchor/">Anchored positioning</a> 
would make that not just possible, but fairly easy to do.</p>

<h3 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h3>

<p>Following on anchored positioning, I’d love to have 
<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-exclusions/">CSS Exclusions</a>
finally come to browsers.  Exclusions are a way to mark an element to
have other content avoid it.  You know how floats move out of the normal
flow, but normal-flow text avoids overlapping them?  That’s an exclusion.  
Now imagine being able to position an element by other means, whether
grid layout or absolute positioning or whatever, and then say “have the
content of other elements flow around it”.  Exclusions!  See <a
href="https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/11/css-grid-editorial-layouts/">this
article by Rob Weychert</a> for a more in-depth explanation of a common
use case.</p>

<h3 id="element-transitions">Element transitions</h3>

<p>The web is cool and all, but you know how futuristic interfaces in
movies have pieces of the interface sliding and zooming and popping out and all that
stuff?  <a href="https://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-shared-element-transitions/">Element transitions</a>.  You can already <a
href="https://simple-set-demos.glitch.me/batman-transition/">try them
out in Chrome Canary, Batman</a>, and I’d love to see them across the
board.  Even more, I’d love some gentle, easy-to-follow tutorials on how
to make them work, because even in their single-page form, I found the
coding requirements basically impossible to work out.  Make them all-CSS,
and explain them like I’m a newb, and I’m in.</p>

<h3 id="nested-selectors">Nested Selectors</h3>

<p>A lot of people I know are still hanging on to preprocessors solely
because they permit nested selectors, like:</p>

<pre><code>main {
	padding: 1em;
	background: #F1F1F0;
	
	h2 {
		border-block-end: 1px solid gray;
	}
	p {
		text-indent: 2em;
	}
}</code></pre>

<p>The CSS Working Group has been wrestling with this for quite some
time now, because it turns out the CSS parsing rules make it hard to
just add this, there are a lot of questions about how this should
interact with pseudo-classes like <code>:is()</code>, there are serious
concerns about doing this in a way that will be maximally
future-compatible, <em>and also</em> there has been a whole lot of argument over
whether it’s okay to clash with Sass syntax or not.</p>

<p>So it’s a difficult thing to make happen in native CSS, and the
debates are both wide-ranging and slow, but it’s on my (and probably
nearly everyone else’s) wish list.  You can <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13813/try-css-nesting-today-in-safari-technology-preview/">try it out in Safari Technology Preview</a> 
as I write this, so here’s hoping for accelerating adoption!</p>

<h3 id="more-and-better-has">More and better <code>:has()</code></h3>

<p>Okay, since I’m talking about selectors already, I’ll throw in
universal, full-featured, more optimized support for
<code>:has()</code>.  One browser doesn’t support compound selectors, for
example.  I’ve also thought that maybe some combinators would be nice,
like making <code>a:has(&gt; b)</code> can be made equal to
<code>a &lt; b</code>.</p>

<p>But I also wish for people to basically go crazy with
<code>:has()</code>.  There’s <em>SO MUCH THERE</em>.  There are so many
things we can do with it, and I don’t think we’ve touched even a tiny
fraction of the possibility space.</p>

<h3 id="more-attr">More <code>attr()</code></h3>

<p>I’ve wanted <code>attr()</code> to be more widely accepted in CSS
values since, well, I can’t remember.  A <em>long</em> time.  I want to be
able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>p[data-size] {width: attr(data-width, rem);}

&lt;p data-size=&quot;27&quot;&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Okay, not a great example, but it conveys the idea.  I also talked
about this in <a
href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/08/15/table-column-alignment-with-variable-transforms/">my
post about aligning table columns</a>.

I realize adding this would probably lead to
someone creating a framework called Headgust where all the styling is
jammed into a million <code>data-*</code>attributes and the whole of the
framework’s CSS is nothing but <code>property: attr()</code> declarations 
for every single CSS property known to man, but we shouldn’t let that stop us.</p>

<h3 id="variables-in-media-queries">Variables in media queries</h3>

<p>Basically I want to be able to do this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>:root {--mobile: 35em;}

@media (min-width: var(--mobile)) {
	/* non-mobile styles go here */
}</code></pre>

<p>That’s it.  This was made possible in container queries, I believe, so
maybe it can spread to media (and feature?) queries.  I sure hope so!</p>

<h3 id="logical-modifiers">Logical modifiers</h3>

<p>You can do this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>p {margin-block: 1em; margin-inline: 1rem;}</code></pre>

<p>But you can’t do this:</p>

<pre><code>p {margin: logical 1em 1rem;}</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to do that.  We should <em>all</em> want to be able
to do that, however it’s made possible.</p>

<h3 id="additive-values">Additive values</h3>

<p>You know how you can set a bunch of values with a comma-separated
list, but if you want to override just one of them, you have to do the
whole thing over?  I want to be able to add another thing to the list
without having to do the whole thing over.  So rather than adding a value
like this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>background-clip: content, content, border, padding; /* needed to add padding */</code></pre>

<p>…I want to be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>background-clip: add(padding);</code></pre>

<p>No, I don’t know how to figure out where in the list it should be
added.  I don’t know a lot of things.  I just know I want to be able to do
this.  And also to remove values from a list in a similar way, since I’m
pony-wishing.</p>

<h3 id="color-shading-and-blending">Color shading and blending</h3>

<p>Preprocessors already allow you to say you want the color of an
element to be 30% lighter than it would otherwise be.  Or darker.  Or
blend two colors together.  Native CSS should have the same power.  <a
href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#resolving-mix">It’s being
worked on</a>.  Let’s get it done, browsers.</p>

<h3 id="hanging-punctuation">Hanging punctuation</h3>

<p>Safari has supported <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hanging-punctuation"><code>hanging-punctuation</code></a> for<em>ever</em> (where “for<em>ever</em>”, 
in this case, means since 2016) and it’s long past time for other browsers
to get with the program.  This should be universally supported.
</p>

<h3 id="cross-boundary-styles">Cross-boundary styles</h3>

<p>I want to be able to apply styles from my external (or even embedded) CSS to a resource like an external SVG.  I realize this sets up all kinds
of security and privacy concerns.  I still want to be able to do it.  Every time I have to embed an entire inline SVG into a template just so
I can change the fill color of a logo based on its page context, I grit
my teeth just that little bit harder.  It <em>tasks</em> me.</p>

<h3 id="scoped-styling-including-imports">Scoped styling (including
imports)</h3>

<p>The Mirror Universe version of the previous wish is that I want to be
able to say a bit of CSS, or an entire style sheet (embedded or
external), only applies to a certain DOM node and all its descendants.
“But you can do that with descendant selectors!” Not always.  For that
matter, I’d love to be able to just say:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=&quot;@import(styles.css);&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

<p>…and have that apply to that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and its
descendants, as if it were an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, while
<em>not</em> being an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> so styles from the
document could also apply to it.  Crazy?  Don’t care.  Still want it.</p>

<h3 id="linked-flow-regions">Linked flow regions(?)</h3>

<p>SPECIAL BONUS TENTATIVE WISH: I didn’t particularly like how <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-regions-1/">CSS Regions</a> were
structured, but I really liked the general idea.  It would be really
great to be able to link elements together, and allow the content to
flow between them in a “smooth” manner.  Even to allow the content from
the second region to flow back into the first, if there’s room for it
and nothing prevents it.  I admit, this is really a “try to recreate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker#Release_history">Aldus PageMaker</a>
in CSS” thing for me, but the idea still appeals to me,
and I’d love to see it come to CSS some day.</p>

<hr />

<p>So there you go.  I’d love to hear what you’d like to see added to CSS, either in the comments below or in posts of your own.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ I set up a dirty-rough Dark Mode handler for my web site and am wondering what I might be overlooking. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spurred by <a href="https://home.social/@AppalachianCrochet/109699115126655523">a toot in reply</a> to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb/109670774892464159">a goofy dev joke I made</a>, I’ve set up a dirty-rough Dark Mode handler for meyerweb:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	html body {filter: invert(1);}
	/* the following really should be managed by a cascade layer */
	html img, 
	html img.book.cover, 
	html img.book.cover.big, 
	html #archipelago a:hover img {filter: invert(1);}
	html #thoughts figure.standalone img {
	  box-shadow: 0.25em 0.25em 0.67em #FFF8;
	}
}</code></pre>

<p>It’s the work of about five minutes’ thought and typing, so I suspect it’s teetering on the edge of Minimum Viable Product, but I’m not sure which side of that line it lands on.</p>

<p>Other than restructuring things so that I can use Cascade Layers to handle the Light and Dark Mode styling, what am I missing or overlooking?  <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements, I suppose, but anything else jump out at you as in need of correction?  Let me know!</p>

<p>(P.S. “Use only classes, never IDs” is <em>not</em> something that needs to be corrected.  Yes, I know why people think that, and this situation seems to be an argument in favor of that view, but I have a different view and will not be converting IDs to classes.  Thanks in advance for your forbearance.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve just committed my first ':has()' selector to production CSS and want to share it, so I will!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just committed my first <code>:has()</code> selector to production CSS and want to share it, so I will!  But first, a little context that will feel familiar to nerds like me who post snippets of computer code to the Web, and have markup with this kind of tree structure (not raw source; we’d never allow this much formatting whitespace inside a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>):</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;code&gt;
		{{content goes here}}
	&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>

<p>It’s nicely semantic, indicating that the contents of the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> are in fact code of some kind, as opposed to just plain preformatted text like, say, output from a shell script or npm job, which isn’t code and thus should, perhaps, be styled in a distinct way.</p>

<p>Given cases like that, you’ve probably written rules that go a little something like this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>pre &gt; code {
	display: block;
	background: #f1f1f1;
	padding: 1.33em;
	border-radius: 0.33em;
}</code></pre>

<p>Which says: if a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element is the child of a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element, then turn the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> into a block box and give it some background color, padding, etc.</p>

<p>It works out fine, but it always feels a little fragile.  What if there are already <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> styles that throw off the intended effect on code blocks?  Do we get into specificity wars between those rules and the code-block rules?  Find other ways to figure out what should be adjusted in which cases?  Those are probably manageable problems, but it would be better not to have them.</p>

<p>It’s also, when you step back for a moment, a little weird.  The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> is already a block box and the container for the code; why aren’t we styling that?  Because unless you wrote some scripting, whether server-side or client-side, to add a <code>class</code> to the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> in scenarios like this, there wasn’t a way to address it directly based on its structural contents.</p>

<p>There is now:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>pre:has(&gt; code) {
	background: #f1f1f1;
	padding: 1.33em;
	border-radius: 0.33em;
}</code></pre>

<p>Now I’m styling any <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> that has a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> as a child, which is why I took out the <code>display: block</code>.  I don’t need it any more!</p>

<p>But suppose you have a framework or ancient script or something that inserts classed <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements between the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, like
this:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;pref&quot;&gt;
		&lt;code&gt;
			{{content goes here}}
		&lt;/code&gt;
	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>

<p>First of all, ew, address the root problem here if at all possible.  But if that isn’t possible for whatever reason, you can still style the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> based on the presence of a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> by removing the child combinator from the selector.  In other words:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>pre:has(code) {
	background: #f1f1f1;
	padding: 1.33em;
	border-radius: 0.33em;
}</code></pre>

<p>Now I’m styling any <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> that has a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> as a <em>descendant</em> &#x202F;—&#x2009; child, grandchild, great-great-great-great grandchild, whatever.</p>

<p>Which is not only more robust, it’s a lot more future-proof: even if some hot new front-end framework that sticks in <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements or something gets added to the site next year, this style will just keep chugging along, styling <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements that contain <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements until long after that hot new framework has cooled to ash and been chucked into the bit-bucket.</p>

<p>There is one thing to keep in mind here, as pointed out by <a href="http://emmanuel.clement.free.fr/">Emmanuel</a> over on Mastodon: if you have a scenario where <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements can contain child text nodes in addition to <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks, the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> will still be styled in its entirely.  Consider:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;pre&gt;
	{{some text is here}}
	&lt;code&gt;
		{{content goes here}}
	&lt;/code&gt;
	{{or text is here}}
&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre>

<p><code>pre:has(&gt; code)</code> and <code>pre:has(code)</code> will still match the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element here, which means all of the text (both inside and outside the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements)  will sit inside the light-gray box with the rounded corners.  If that’s fine for your use case, great!  If not, then don’t use <code>:has()</code> in this scenario, and stick with the <code>pre &gt; code {…}</code> or <code>pre code {…}</code> approach of yore.  That will style just the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements instead of the whole <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, as in the example at the beginning of this article.</p>

<p>As I write this, the code hasn’t gone into production on <a href="https://wpewebkit.org">wpewebkit.org</a> yet, but I think it will within the next week or two, and will be my first wide-production use of <code>:has()</code>.  I feel like it’s a great way to close out 2022 and kick off 2023, because I <em>am</em> that kind of nerd.  If you are too, I hope you enjoyed this quick dive into the world of <code>:has()</code>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Styling images posted on mastodon.social based on whether or not they have alt text.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, I published <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2021/01/01/highlighting-accessible-twitter-content/">user styles to visually highlight images on Twitter that didn’t have <code>alt</code> text</a> &#x202F;—&#x2009; this was in the time
before the “ALT” badge and the much improved accessibility features
Twitter deployed in the pre-Musk era.</p>

<p>With the mass Mastodon migration currently underway in the circles I
frequent, I spend more time there, and I missed the quick visual
indication of images having alt text, as well as my de-emphasis styles
for those images that don’t have useful alt text.  So I put the two together and
wrote a new user stylesheet, which I apply via the <a href="https://add0n.com/stylus.html">Stylus browser extension</a>.  If you’d like to also use it, please do so!</p>

<pre class="css"><code>/* ==UserStyle==
@name           mastodon.social - 12/14/2022, 9:37:56 AM
@namespace      github.com/openstyles/stylus
@version        1.0.0
@description    Styles images posted on mastodon.social based on whether or not they have alt text.
@author         @Meyerweb@mastodon.social, https://meyerweb.com/
==/UserStyle== */

@-moz-document regexp(".*\.social.*") {
	.media-gallery__item-thumbnail img:not([alt]) {
		filter: grayscale(1) contrast(0.5);
	}
	.media-gallery__item-thumbnail img:not([alt]):hover {
		filter: none;
	}
	.media-gallery__item-thumbnail:has(img[alt]) {
		position: relative;
	}
	.media-gallery__item-thumbnail:has(img[alt])::after {
		content: "ALT";
		position: absolute;
		bottom: 0;
		right: 0;
		border-radius: 5px 0 0 0;
		border: 1px solid #FFF3;
		color: #FFFD;
		background: #000A;
		border-width: 1px 0 0 1px;
		padding-block: 0.5em 0.4em;
		padding-inline: 0.7em 0.8em;
		font: bold 90% sans-serif;
	}
}</code></pre>

<p>Because most of my (admittedly limited and sporadic) Mastodon time is
spent on <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>, the styles I wrote are attuned to
mastodon.social’s markup.  I set things up so these styles should be
applied to any <code>*.social</code> site, but only those who use the
same markup mastodon.social uses will get the benefits.  <a href="https://pinafore.social">pinafore.social</a>,
for example, has different markup (I think they’re using Svelte).</p>

<p>You can always adapt the selectors to fit the markup of whatever
Mastodon instance you use, if you’re so inclined.  Please feel free to share your
changes in the comments, or in posts of your own.  And with any luck,
this will be a temporary solution before Mastodon adds these sorts of
things natively, just as Twitter eventually did.</p>

<hr />

<p>Addendum: <a href="https://i.calckey.cloud/notes/98rnf3llwt">It was rightly pointed out to me</a> that Firefox does not, as of this writing, support <code>:has()</code> by default.  If you want to use this in Firefox, as I do, set the <code>layout.css.has-selector.enabled</code> flag in <code>about:config</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many of you, I’ve been checking out Mastodon and finding more and more things I like.  Including the use of <a href="https://gmpg.org/xfn">XFN (XHTML Friends Network)</a> semantics to verify ownership of sites you link from your profile’s metadata!  What that means is, you can add up to four links in your profile, and if you have an XFN-compliant link on that URL pointing to your Mastodon profile, it will show up as verified as actually being your site.</p>

<p>Okay, that probably also comes off a little confusing.  Let me walk through the process.</p>

<p>First, go to your home Mastodon server and edit your profile.  On servers like <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>, there should be an “Edit profile” link under your user avatar.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/xfn-mastodon-profile-edit.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/xfn-mastodon-profile-edit.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>Here’s what it looks like for me.  Yes, I prefer Light Mode.  No, I don’t want to have a debate about it.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I saw the same thing on another Mastodon server where I have an account, so it seems to be common to Mastodon in general.  I can’t know what every Mastodon server does, though, so you might have to root around to find how you edit your profile.  (Similarly, I can’t be sure that everything will be exactly as I depict it below, but hopefully it will be at least reasonably close.)</p>

<p>Under “Appearance” in the profile editing screen, which I believe is the default profile editing page, there should be a section called “Profile metadata”.  You’ll probably have to scroll a bit to reach it.  You can add up to four labels with content, and a very common label is “Web” or “Homepage” with the URL of your personal server.  They don’t all have to be links to sites; you could add your favorite color or relationship preference(s) or whatever</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/xfn-mastodon-profile-metadata.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/xfn-mastodon-profile-metadata.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>I filled a couple of these in for demonstration purposes, but now they’re officially part of my profile.  No, I don’t want to debate indentation preferences, either.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But look, over there next to the table, there’s a “Verification” section, with a little bit of explanation and a field containing some markup you can copy, but it’s cut off before the end of the markup.  Here’s what mine looks like in full:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;a rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If I take this markup and add it to any URL I list in my metadata, then that entry in my metadata table will get special treatment, because it will mean I’ve verified it.</p>

<p>The important part is the <code>rel="me"</code>, which establishes a shared identity.  Here’s how it’s (partially) described by <a href="https://gmpg.org/xfn/11">XFN 1.1</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A link to yourself at a different URL. Exclusive of all other XFN values. Required symmetric.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I admit, that’s written in terse spec-speak, so let’s see how this works out in practice.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the markup in <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb">my Mastodon profile’s page</a>.  Any link to another site in the table of profile metadata has a <code>me</code> value in the <code>rel</code> attribute, like so:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;a href=&quot;https://meyerweb.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer me&quot;&gt;</code></pre>

<p>That means I’ve claimed via Mastodon that <code>meyerweb.com</code> is me at another URL.</p>

<p>But that’s not enough, because I could point at the home page of, say, Wikipedia as if it were mine.  That’s why XFN requires the relationship to be symmetric, which is to say, there needs to be a <code>rel="me"</code> annotated link on each end.  (On both ends.  However you want to say that.)</p>

<p>So on the page being pointed to, which in my case is <code>https://meyerweb.com/</code>, I need to include a link back to my Mastodon profile page, and that link <em>also</em> has to have <code>rel="me"</code>.  That’s the markup Mastodon provided for me to copy, which we saw before and I’ll repeat here:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;a rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Again, the important part is that the <code>href</code> points to my Mastodon profile page, and there’s a <code>rel</code> attribute containing <code>me</code>.  It can contain other things, like <code>noreferrer</code>, but needs to have <code>me</code> for the verfiication to work.  Note that the content of the link element doesn’t have to be the text “Mastodon”.  <a href="https://meyerweb.com/#archipelago">In my case</a>, I’m using a Mastodon logo, with the markup looking like this:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;a rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;img src=&quot;/pix/icons/mastodon.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Mastodon&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>With that in place, there’s a “me” link pointing to a page that contains a “me” link.  That’s a symmetric relationship, as XFN requires, and it verifies that the two pages have a shared owner.  Who is me!</p>

<p>Thus, if you go to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb">my Mastodon profile page</a>, in the table of my profile metadata, the entry for my homepage is specially styled to indicate it’s been verified as actually belonging to me.</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/xfn-mastodon-profile-table.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/xfn-mastodon-profile-table.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>The table as it appears on my profile page for me.  Your colors may vary.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And that’s how it works.</p>

<p>Next question: how can I verify my GitHub page?  At the moment, I’d have to put my Mastodon profile page’s URL into the one open field for URLs in GitHub profiles, because GitHub also does the <code>rel="me"</code> thing for its profile links.  But if I do that, I’d have to remove the link to my homepage, which I don’t want to do.</p>

<p>Until GitHub either provides a dedicated Mastodon profile field the way it provides a dedicated Twitter profile field, or else allows people to add multiple URLs to their profiles the way Mastodon does, I won’t be able to verify my GitHub page on Mastodon.  Not a huge deal for me, personally, but in general it would be nice to see GitHub become more flexible in this area.  Very smart people <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/109299951474378922">are also asking for this</a>, so hopefully that will happen soon(ish).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Making a dashed line that has a visible gradient from one color to another, only this time, a dashed gradient is used to create the gaps in the line, not the dashes]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I talked in my last post about <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/10/19/a-dashing-navbar-solution/">how I used linear gradients to recreate dashed lines</a> for the navlinks and navbar of <a href="https://wpewebkit.org">wpewebkit.org</a>, but that wasn’t the last instance of dashing gradients in the design.  I had occasion to use that technique again, except this time as a way to create a gradient dash.  I mean, a dashed line that has a visible gradient from one color to another, as well as a dashed line that’s constructed using a linear gradient.  Only this time, the dashed gradient is used to create the gaps, not the dashes.</p>
<p>To set the stage, here’s the bit of the design I had to create:</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-01.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-01.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>
Design!
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The vertical dashed line down the left side of the design is a dashed linear gradient, but that’s not actually relevant.  It could have been a dashed border style, or an SVG, or really anything.  And that image on the right is a PNG, but that’s also not really relevant.  What’s relevant is I had to make sure the image was centered in the content column, and yet its dashed line connected to the left-side dashed line, regardless of where the image landed in the actual content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the colors of the two dashed lines were different at the point I was doing the implementation: the left-side line was flat black, and the line in the image was more of a dark gray.  I could have just connected a dark gray line to the black, but it didn’t look right.  A color transition was needed, while still being a dashed line.</p>
<p>Ideally, I was looking for a solution that would allow a smooth color fade over the connecting line’s length while <em>also</em> allowing the page background color to show through.  Because the page background might sometimes be white and sometimes be a light blue and might in the future be lime green wavy pattern or something, who knows.</p>
<p>So I used a dashed linear gradient as a mask.  The CSS goes like this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>.banner::before {
	content: &#39;&#39;;
	position: absolute;
	top: 50%;
	left: -5rem;
	width: 5rem;
	height: 1px;
	background: linear-gradient(90deg, #222, #888);
	mask-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
		270deg, transparent, #999 1px 3px, transparent 4px 7px);
}</code></pre>

<p>Please allow me to break it down a step at a time.</p>
<p>First, there’s the positioning of the pseudo-element, reaching leftward <code>5rem</code> from the left edge of the content column, which here I’ve annotated with a red outline. (I prefer outlines to borders because outlines don’t participate in layout, so they can’t shift things around.)</p>

<pre class="css"><code>.banner::before {
	content: &#39;&#39;;
	position: absolute;
	top: 50%;
	left: -5rem;
	width: 5rem;
	height: 1px;
}</code></pre>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-02.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-02.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>
The very skinny-short red box is where the connecting line needs to be
drawn.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To that pseudo-element, I added a 90-degree-pointing linear gradient from black to gray to its background.</p>

<pre class="css"><code>	…
	background: linear-gradient(90deg, #222, #888);
}</code></pre>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-03.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-03.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>
The gradient filling the entire background of the pseudo-element.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The pseudo-element does happen to touch the end of one of the vertical dashes, but that’s purely by coincidence.  It could have landed anywhere, including between two dashes.</p>
<p>So now it was time for a mask.  CSS Masks are images used to hide parts of an element based on the contents of the masking image, usually its alpha channel. (Using luminosity to define transparency levels via the <code>mask-mode</code> property is also an option, but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-mode#browser_compatibility">Chrome doesn’t support that</a> as yet.)  For example, you can use small images to clip off the corners of an element.</p>
<p>In this case, I defined a repeating linear gradient because I knew what size the dashes should be, and I didn’t want to mess with <code>mask-size</code> and <code>mask-repeat</code> (ironically enough, as you’ll see in a bit).  This way, the mask is 100% the size of the element’s box, and I just need to repeat the gradient pattern however many times are necessary to cross the entire width of the element’s background.</p>
<p>Given the design constraints, I wanted the dash pattern to start from the right side, the one next to the image, and repeat leftward, to ensure that the dash pattern would look unbroken.  Thus I set its direction to be 270 degrees.  Here I’ll have it alternate between red and transparent, because the actual color used for the opaque parts of the mask doesn’t matter, only its opacity:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>	…
	mask-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
		270deg, transparent, red 1px 3px, transparent 4px 7px);
}</code></pre>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-04.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-04.png" alt=""  /></a>
<figcaption>
The pseudo-element being masked over and over again to create a dashed
line that allows the backdrop to show through.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The way the mask works, the transparent parts of the masking image cause the corresponding parts of the element to be transparent &#x202F;—&#x2009; to be clipped away, in effect.  The opaque parts, whatever color they actually have, cause the corresponding parts of the element to be drawn.  Thus, the parts of the background’s black-to-gray gradient that line up with the opaque parts of the mask are rendered, and the rest of the gradient is not.  Thus, a color-fading dashed line.</p>
<p>This is actually why I separated the ends of the color stops by a pixel: by defining a one-pixel distance for the transition from transparent to opaque (and vice versa), the browser fills those pixels in with something partway between those two states.  It’s probably 50% opaque, but that’s really up to the browser.</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-05.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-05.png" alt="" /></a>
<figcaption>
The pixels of the repeating gradient pattern, shown here in the reading
order of the CSS value.  In practice, this pattern is flipped
horizontally, since its gradient arrow points to 270 degrees (leftward).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The result is a softening effect, which matches well with the dashed line in the image itself and doesn’t look out of place when it meets up with the left-hand vertical dashed line.</p>
<p>At least, everything I just showed you is what happens in Firefox, which proudly supports all the masking properties.  In Chromium and WebKit browsers, you need vendor prefixes for masking to work.  So here’s how the CSS turned out:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>.banner::before {
	content: &#39;&#39;;
	position: absolute;
	top: 50%;
	left: -5rem;
	width: 5rem;
	height: 1px;
	background: linear-gradient(90deg, #222, #888);
	-webkit-mask-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
		270deg, transparent, red 1px 3px, transparent 4px 7px);
	mask-image: repeating-linear-gradient(
		270deg, transparent, red 1px 3px, transparent 4px 7px);
}</code></pre>

<p>And that’s where we were at launch.</p>
<p>It still bugged me a little, though, because the dashes I created were one pixel tall, but the dashes in the image weren’t.  They were more like a pixel and a half tall once you take the aliasing into account, so they probably started out 2 (or more)  pixels tall and then got scaled down.  The transition from those visually-slightly-larger dashes to the crisply-one-pixel-tall pseudo-element didn’t look quite right.</p>
<p>I’d hoped that just increasing the height of the pseudo-element to <code>2px</code> would work, but that made the line look too thick.  That meant I’d have to basically recreate the aliasing myself.</p>
<p>At first I considered leaving the mask as it was and setting up two linear gradients, the existing one on the bottom and a lighter one on top.  Instead, I chose to keep the single background gradient and set up two masks, the original on the bottom and a more transparent one on top.  Which meant I’d have to size and place them, and keep them from tiling.  So, despite my earlier avoidance, I had to mess with mask sizing and repeating anyway.</p>

<pre class="css"><code>mask-image:
	repeating-linear-gradient(
		270deg, transparent, #89A4 1px 3px, transparent 4px 7px),
	repeating-linear-gradient(
		270deg, transparent, #89A 1px 3px, transparent 4px 7px);
	mask-size: 100% 1px;
	mask-repeat: no-repeat;
	mask-position: 100% 0%, 100% 100%;</code></pre>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-06.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-connect-06.png" alt=""  /></a>
<figcaption>
Two masks, one effect.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And that’s how it stands as of today.</p>
<p>In the end, this general technique is pretty much infinitely adaptable, in that you could define any dash pattern you like and have it repeat over a gradient, background image, or even just a plain background color.  It could be used to break up an element containing text, so it looks like the text has been projected onto a thick dashed line, or put some diagonal slashes through text, or an image, or a combination.</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<div
style="background: linear-gradient(270deg,dodgerblue,25%,palegoldenrod)">
<div
style="padding-block: 0.15em 0; font: bold 3em sans-serif; text-align: center; -webkit-mask: repeating-linear-gradient(123deg,black 0 0.13em,#0003 0.15em 0.18em, #000 0.2em);">
SLASHED TEXT
</div>
</div>
<figcaption>
No PNG, no SVG, just text and CSS.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Or use a tiled radial gradient to make your own dotted line, one that’s fully responsive without ever clipping a dot partway through.  Wacky line patterns with tiled, repeated conic gradients?  Sure, why not?</p>
<p>The point being, masks let you break up the rectangularity of elements, which can go a long way toward making designs feel more alive.  Give ’em a try and see what you come up with!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How I used background gradients to recreate dashed borders as part of a contextually flexible linking design element.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<style type="text/css">
#thoughts figure.standalone img {
box-shadow: 0.25em 0.25em 0.67em #0008;
margin-block-end: 0.5em;
}
</style>
<p>One of the many things <a href="https://igalia.com/">Igalia</a> does is maintain an official port of WebKit for embedded devices called WPE WebKit, and as you might expect, it has <a href="https://wpewebkit.org/">a web site</a>.  The design had gotten a little stale since its launch a few years ago, so we asked Denis Radenković at <a href="http://38one.com/">38one</a> to come up with a new design, which we launched yesterday.  And I got to turn it into HTML and CSS!  Which was mostly normal stuff, margins and font sizing and all that, but also had some bits that called for some creativity.</p>
<p>There was one aspect of the design that I honestly thought wasn’t going to be possible, which was the way the “current page” link in the site navbar connected up to the rest of the page’s design via a dashed line. You can see it on the site, or in this animation about how each navlink was designed to appear.</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-anim.gif"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-anim.gif" alt=""/></a>
<figcaption>
Navigation link styles, not including the Home button, which is essentially the same but not nearly as obvious because of its specific layout.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I thought about using bog-standard dashed element borders: one on a filler element or pseudo-element that spanned the mostly-empty left side of the navbar, and one on each navlink before the current one, and then… I don’t know. I didn’t get that far, because I realized the dashed borders would almost certainly stutter, visually. What I mean is, the dashes wouldn’t follow a regular on-off pattern, which would look fairly broken.</p>
<p>My next thought was to figure out how to size a filler element or pseudo-element so that it was the exact width needed to reach the middle of the active navlink. Maybe there’s a clever way to do that with just HTML and CSS, but I couldn’t think of a way to do it that wasn’t either structurally nauseating or dependent on me writing clever JavaScript. So I tossed that idea, though I’ll return to it at the end of the post.</p>
<p>In the end, it was the interim development styles that eventually got me there. See, while building out other parts of the design, I just threw a dashed border on the bottom of the navbar, which (as is the way of borders) spanned its entire bottom edge. At some point I glanced up at it and thought, <em>If only I could figure out a mask that would clip off the part of the border I don’t need.</em> And slowly, I realized that with a little coding sleight-of-hand, I could almost exactly do that.</p>
<p>First, I removed the bottom border from the navbar and replaced it with a dashed linear gradient background, like this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>nav.global {
	background-image: linear-gradient(
		90deg,
		currentColor 25%,
		transparent 25% 75%,
		currentColor 75%
	);
	background-position: 0 100%;
	background-size: 8px 1px;
	background-repeat: repeat-x;
}</code></pre>

<p>(Okay, I actually used the <code>background</code> shorthand form of the above&#x202F;—&#x2009;<code>linear-gradient(…) 0 100% / 8px 1px repeat-x</code>&#x202F;—&#x2009;but the result is the same.)</p>
<p>I thought about using <code>repeating-linear-gradient</code>, which would have let me skip having to declare a <code>background-repeat</code>, but would have required me to size the gradient’s color stops using length units instead of percentages. I liked how, with the above, I could set the color stops with percentages, and then experiment with the size of the image using <code>background-size</code>. (<code>7px 1px</code>? <code>9px 1px</code>? <code>8px 1.33px</code>? Tried ’em all, and then some.) But that’s mostly a personal preference, not based in any obvious performance or clarity win, so if you want to try this with a repeating gradient, go for it.</p>
<p>But wait. What was the point of recreating the border’s built-in dash effect with a gradient background? Well, as I said, it made it easier to experiment with different sizes. It also allowed me to create a dash pattern that would be very consistent across browsers, which <code>border-style</code> dashes very much are not.</p>
<p>But primarily, I wanted the dashes to be in the background of the navbar because I could then add small solid-color gradients to the backgrounds of the navlinks that come after the active one.</p>

<pre class="css"><code>nav.global li.currentPage ~ li {
	background: linear-gradient(0deg, #FFF 2px, transparent 2px);
}</code></pre>
<p>That selects all the following-sibling list items of the
<code>currentPage</code>-classed list item, which here is the “Learn
&amp; Discover” link.</p>
<pre class="html"><code>&lt;ul class=&quot;about off&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;nav-link&quot; href=&quot;…&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;currentPage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;nav-link&quot; href=&quot;…&quot;&gt;Learn &amp;amp; Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;nav-link&quot; href=&quot;…&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;nav-link&quot; href=&quot;…&quot;&gt;Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn cta&quot; href=&quot;…&quot;&gt;Get Started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Here’s the result, with the gradient set to be visible with a pinkish fill instead of <code>#FFF</code> so we can see it:</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-1.gif"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-1.gif" alt=""/></a>
<figcaption>
The “masking” gradients, here set to be a nicely rosy pink instead of the usual solid white.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see how the pink hides the dashes. In the actual styles, because the <code>#FFF</code> is the same as the design’s page background, those list items’ background gradients are placed over top of (and thus hide) the navbar’s background dash.</p>
<p>I should point out that the color stop on the white solid gradient could have been at <code>1px</code> rather than <code>2px</code> and still worked, but I decided to give myself a little bit of extra coverage, just for peace of mind. I should also point out that I didn’t
just fill the backgrounds of the list items with <code>background-color: #FFF</code> because the navbar has a semitransparent white background fill and a blurring <code>background-filter</code>, so the page content can be hazily visible through the navbar, as shown here.</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-2.gif"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-2.gif" alt=""/></a>
<figcaption>
The backdrop-blurring of content behind the navbar, not blurring nearly as much as I thought they should, but oh well.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The white line is slightly suboptimal in this situation, but it doesn’t really stand out and does add a tiny bit of visual accent to the navbar’s edge, so I was willing to go with it.</p>
<p>The next step was a little trickier: there needs to be a vertical dashed line “connecting” to the navbar’s dashed line at the horizontal center of the link, <em>and also</em> the navbar’s dashed line needs to be hidden, but only to the right of the vertical dashed line. I thought about doing two background gradients on the list item, one for the vertical dashed line and one for the white “mask”, but I realized that constraining the vertical dashed line to be half the height of the list item while also getting the repeating pattern correct was too much for my brain to figure out.</p>
<p>Instead, I positioned and sized a generated pseudo-element like this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>nav.global ul li.currentPage {
	position: relative;
}
nav.global ul li.currentPage::before {
	content: &#39;&#39;;
	position: absolute;
	z-index: 1;
	top: 50%;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 50%;
	right: 0;
	background:
		linear-gradient(180deg,
			currentColor 25%,
			transparent 25% 75%, 
			currentColor 75%) 0 0 / 1px 8px repeat-y, 
		linear-gradient(0deg, #FFFF 2px, transparent 2px);
	background-size: 1px 0.5em, auto;
}</code></pre>

<p>That has the generated pseudo-element fill the bottom right quadrant of the active link’s list item, with a vertical dashed linear gradient running along its left edge and a solid white two-pixel gradient along its bottom edge, with the solid white below the vertical dash. Here it is, with the background pinkishly filled in to be visible behind the two gradients.</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-3-1.gif"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-3-1.gif" alt=""/></a>
<figcaption>
That’s the <code>::before</code> with its background filled in a rosy pink instead of the usual transparency.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With that handled, the last step was to add the dash across the bottom of the current-page link and then mask the vertical line with a background color, like so:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>nav.global ul li.currentPage a {
	position: relative;
	z-index: 2;
	background: var(--dashH); /* converted the dashes to variables */
	background-size: 0.5em 1px;
	background-position: 50% 100%;
	background-color: #FFF;
}</code></pre>

<p>And that was it. Now, any of the navbar links can be flagged as the current page (with a <code>class</code> of <code>currentPage</code> on the enclosing list item) and will automatically link up with the dashes across the bottom of the navbar, with the remainder of that navbar dash hidden by the various solid white gradient background images.</p>

<figure class="standalone">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-anim.gif"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/wpe-navbar-anim.gif" alt=""/></a>
<figcaption>
An animation of the link styles, only now you know how they work.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, it’s kind of a hack, and I wish there were a cleaner way to do this. And maybe there is! I pondered setting up a fine-grained grid and adding an SVG with a dashed path, or maybe a filler <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, to join the current link to the line. That also feels like a hack, but maybe less of one. Or maybe not!</p>
<p>What I believe I want are the capabilities promised by the <a href="http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-anchor-position/">Anchored Positioning</a> proposal. I <em>think</em> I could have done something like:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>nav.global {position: relative;}
nav.global .currentPage {anchor-name: --navLink;}
nav.global::before {
	position: absolute;
	left: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	right: var(--center);
	--center: anchor(--navLink 50%);
	top: anchor(--navLink bottom);
}</code></pre>

<p>…and then used that to run the dashed line over from the left side of the page to underneath the midpoint of the current link, and then up to the bottom edge of that link. Which would have done away with the need for the <code>li ~ li</code> overlaid-background hack, and nearly all the other hackery. I mean, I enjoy hackery as much as the next codemonaut, but I’m happier when the hacks are more elegant and minimal.</p>

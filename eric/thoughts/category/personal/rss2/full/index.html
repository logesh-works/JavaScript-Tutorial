					<description><![CDATA[Last week, I designed a logo for the podcast I do at Igalia.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I’ve been doing at <a href="https://igalia.com">Igalia</a> of late is podcasting with Brian Kardell.  It’s called “<a href="https://www.igalia.com/24-7/chats">Igalia Chats</a>”, and last week, I designed it a logo.  I tried out a number of different ideas, ran them past the Communication team for feedback, and settled on this one.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/igalia-chats-logo.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/igalia-chats-logo.jpg" alt="The Igalia Chats logo, which combines the official full Igalia logo of a many-colored circle and the name of the company with the word “Chats” below the logo in a slightly larger font size than that used for the name of the company.  Next to them is a large stylized icon of a microphone." /></a>
  <figcaption>D&amp;AD Awards committee, you know where to find me.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And there you have it, the first logo I’ve designed in… well, in quite a while.  My work this time around was informed by a few things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Podcast apps, sites, etc.  expect a square image for the podcast’s logo.  This doesn’t mean you have to make the visible part of it square, exactly, but it does mean any wide-and-short logo will simultaneously feel cramped and lost in a vast void.  Or maybe just very far away.  The version shown in this post is <em>not</em> the square version, because this is not a podcast app and because I could.  The square version just adds more empty whitespace at the top and bottom, anyway.</li>
<li>I couldn’t really alter the official logo in any major way: the brand guidelines are pretty strong and shouldn’t be broken without collective approval.  Given the time that would take, I decided to just work with the logo as-is, and think about possible variants (say, the microphone icon in the blank diamond of the logo) in a later stage.  I did think about just not using the official logo at all, but that felt like it would end up looking too generic.  Besides, we hav e a pretty nifty logo there, so why not use it?</li>
<li>A typeface for the word “Chats” that works well with Igalia’s official logo.  I used <a href="https://www.stormtype.com/families/etelka">Etelka</a>, which is a font we already use on the web site, and I think is the basis of the semi-serifed letters in the official logo anyway.  Though I could be wrong about that; while I definitely have opinions about typefaces these days, I’m not very good at identifying them, or being able to distinguish between two similar fonts.  Call it typeface blindness.</li>
<li>Using open-source resources where possible; thus, the microphone icon came from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a>.  I then modified it a bit (rounded the linecaps, shortened the pickup’s brace) to balance its visual weight with the rest of the design, and not crowd the letters too much.  I also added a subtle vertical gradient to the icon, which helped the word “Chats” to stand out a little more.  Gotta make the logo pop, donchaknow?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably some adjustments I’ll make after a bit of time, but I was determined not to let perfect be the enemy of shipping.  As for how I came to create the logo, you’re probably thinking fancy CSS Grid layout and custom fonts and all that jazz, but no, I just dumped everything into <a href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> and fiddled with ideas until I had some I liked.  It’s not a fantastic environment for this sort of work, I expect, but it’s Good Enough For Me™.</p>

<p>So, if you’re subscribed to <a href="https://www.igalia.com/24-7/chats">Igalia Chats</a> via your listening channel of choice, you should be seeing a new logo.  If you <em>aren’t</em> subscribed… try us, won’t you?  Brian and I talk about a lot of web-related stuff with a lot of really interesting people &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;most recently, with <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/polypane">Kilian Valkhof about the web development application Polypane</a>, with <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/undersea"> Stephen Shankland about undersea data cables</a>, with <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/zach"> Zach Leatherman about open-source work and funding</a>, and many more.  Plus sometimes we just talk with each other about what’s new in Web land, things <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/baseline"> like Google Baseline</a> or <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/safari-16">huge WebKit updates</a>.  And, yes, sometimes we talk about what Igalia is up to, like <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/servo"> our work on the Servo engine</a> or <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/steam-powered-open-source">the Steam Deck</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of the things I quite enjoy about working for Igalia&#160;&#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;the way I can draw upon all the things I’ve learned over my many (many) years to create different things.  A logo last week, a thumbnail-building tool the week before, writing news posts, recording podcasts, doing audio production, figuring out transcription technology, and on and on and on.  It can sometimes be frustrating in the way all work can be, but it rarely gets boring. (And if that sounds good to you, <a href="https://www.igalia.com/jobs/open/">we are hiring</a> for a number of roles!)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A year or so ago, I set about listening through my entire music library alphabetically by song title.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other week I crossed a midpoint, of sorts: as I was driving home from a weekly commitment, my iPhone segued from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxwRzW6ehAU">Rush’s “Mystic Rhythms”</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXJBS1Up_kg">The Seatbelts’ “N.Y.  Rush”</a>, which is, lexicographically speaking, the middle of my iTu&#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;oh <em> excuse</em> me, the middle of my Music Dot App Library, where I passed from the “M” songs into the “N” songs.</p>

<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Troubadour.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Troubadour.jpg" alt="" class="pic" /></a>

<p>See, about a year or so ago, I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.kevinsmokler.com/" rel="acquaintance met">Kevin Smokler</a> to set about listening through my entire music library alphabetically by song title.  Thus, I started with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfXtcvmkiw">“ABC’s” by K’naan</a> and will end, probably in a year or so, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgVTmt6t3hg">“9999999” by Mike Morasky (a.k.a Aperture Science Psychoacoustics Laboratory)</a>.</p>

<p>Every time I have to drive my car for more than a few minutes, I’ll plug in my iPhone and continue the listen from where I left off.  This mainly happens during the aforementioned weekly commitment, which usually sees me driving for an hour or so.  I also listen to it while I’m doing chores around the house like installing ceiling fans or diagnosing half-dead Christmas light strings.</p>

<p>This sort of listen is, in many ways, like listening to the entire library on shuffle, because, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Spool">Jared Spool</a> used to point out (and probably still does), alphabetically sorting a long list of things is indistinguishable from having it randomized.  For me, the main difference between alphabetical and random is that it’s a lot easier to pick back up where you left off when working through alphabetically. (Yes, Music Dot App should do that automatically, but sometimes it forgets where it was.) You can also be a lot more certain that every song gets a listen, something that’s harder to ensure if you’re listening to a random shuffle of a couple thousand tracks and your software loses its place.</p>

<p>There are other advantages: sometimes, artists will use the same song title, and you get interesting combinations.  For example, there was “America”, which gave me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cTC6rGE9jo">a song by K’naan</a> and then a same-titled, but <em>very</em> different, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4BmaBNDmgQ">song by Spinal Tap</a>.  Similarly, there are titular combinations that pop out, like  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0t0e1npyYM">“Come On” by The Goo Goo Dolls</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LiUG0Chubg">“Come On In, The Dreams Are Fine” by Dee-Lite</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En4szIQL9Yo">“Come On Over” by Elana Stone</a>.</p>

<p>Some of these combinations groove, some delight, some earn the stank face, and some make me literally laugh out loud.  And some aren’t related by title but still go together really, really well.  A recent example was the segue from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzVjZu4fl4o">The Prodigy’s “Narayan”</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfQD1QiQ9o4">Radiohead’s “The National Anthem”</a>, which sonically flowed <em> just right</em> at the switchover, almost like they’d been composed to have that effect.  It made this old <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/yfo/">long-ago radio DJ</a> smile.</p>

<p>I say I took inspiration from Kevin because my listen has a couple of differences to his:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kevin has a “no skips, ever” rule, but I will skip songs that are repeats.  This happens a lot when you have both live and studio albums, as I do for a few artists (particularly 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(band)">Rush</a>), or have copied tracks for lightly-engineered playlists, as I have a few times.  That said, if I have a song by one artist and a cover of that song by another, I don’t skip either of them.  For remixes or alternate recordings of a song by the same artist, I generally don’t skip, unless the remix is just the original song with a vaguely different beat track.</li>
<li>I filtered out most of my classical content before starting.  This is not because I dislike classical, but because they tend to sort together in unrelenting clumps &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;all of Beethoven’s and Mozart’s symphonies one after another after another, for example &#x202F;—&#x2009;&#160;and I wanted a varietal mix.  I did keep “classical” albums like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carreras_Domingo_Pavarotti_in_Concert"><cite>Carreras Domingo Pavarotti in Concert</cite></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana_(Orff)"><cite>Carmina Burana</cite></a> because they have normal-length tracks with titles that scatter them throughout the sort.  The same reasoning was used to retain classic film and TV scores, even if I was stretching it a bit to leave in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage#LP_and_cassette"><cite>The Music of Cosmos</cite></a> (the 1980 one), which prefixes all its tracks with Roman numerals…&#160;but each track is a medley, so it got a pass.  The whole-album-in-a-single-MP3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmos#Soundtrack"><cite>The Music of Osmos</cite></a>, on the other hand, did not.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Portal-2_-Songs-to-Test-By.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/Portal-2_-Songs-to-Test-By.jpg" alt="" class="pic" /></a>

<p>All that said, I have a much shorter road than Kevin: he has a library of over twelve <em>thousand</em> tracks, whereas my slightly-filtered library is just shy of 2,500 tracks, or right around 160 hours.  The repeated-song skips knock the total time down a bit, probably by a few hours but not much more than that.  So, figure at an average of 80 minutes per week, that’s about 120 weeks, or two years and four months to get from beginning to end.</p>

<p>And what will I do when I reach the end?  Probably go back to better curate the sorting (e.g., configuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU4L6THYAbM">Soundgarden’s “4th of July”</a> to be sorted as “Fourth of July”), create a playlist that cuts out the repeats ahead of time, and start over.  But we’ll see when I get there.  Maybe next time I’ll listen to it in reverse alphabetical order instead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I ran OpenAI’s Whisper on my laptop to transcribe some videos, and it did an astonishingly good job.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happened was, I was hanging out in an online chatter channel when a little birdy named <a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/" rel="friend colleague met">Bruce</a> chirped about <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">OpenAI’s Whisper</a> and how he was using it to transcribe audio.  And I thought, <em>Hey, I have audio that needs to be transcribed.</em>  Brucie Bird also mentioned it would output text, SRT, and WebVTT formats, and I thought, <em>Hey, I have videos I’ll need to upload with transcription to YouTube!</em>  And <strong>then</strong> he said you could run it from the command line, and I thought, <em>Hey, <strong>I</strong> have a command line!</em></p>

<p>So off I went to install it and try it out, and immediately ran smack into some hurdles I thought I’d document here in case someone else has similar problems.  All of this took place on <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/02/23/a-leap-of-decades/">my M2 MacBook Pro</a>, though I believe most of the below should be relevant to anyone trying to do this at the command line.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was what the GitHub repository’s README recommended, which is:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ pip install -U openai-whisper</code>
</pre>

<p>That failed because I didn’t have <code>pip</code> installed.  Okay, fair enough.  I figured out how to install that, setting up an alias of <code>python</code> for <code>python3</code> along the way, and then tried again.  This time, the install started and then bombed out:</p>

<pre><code>Collecting openai-whisper
  Using cached openai-whisper-20230314.tar.gz (792 kB)
  Installing build dependencies ...  done
  Getting requirements to build wheel ...  done
  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ...  done
Collecting numba
  Using cached numba-0.56.4.tar.gz (2.4 MB)
  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ...  error
  error: subprocess-exited-with-error</code>
</pre>

<p>…followed by some stack trace stuff, none of which was really useful until ten or so lines down, where I found:</p>

<pre><code>RuntimeError: Cannot install on Python version 3.11.2; only versions &gt;=3.7,&lt;3.11 are supported.</code>
</pre>

<p>In other words, the version of Python I have installed is <em>too modern</em> to run AI.  What a world.</p>

<p>I DuckDucked around a bit and hit upon <code>pyenv</code>, which is I guess a way of installing and running older versions of Python without having to overwrite whatever version(s) you already have.  I’ll skip over the error part of my trial-and-error process and give you the commands that made it all work:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ brew install pyenv

$ pyenv install 3.10

$ PATH="~/.pyenv/shims:${PATH}"

$ pyenv local 3.10

$ pip install -U openai-whisper</code>
</pre>

<p>That got Whisper to install.  It didn’t take very long.</p>

<p>At that point, I wondered what I’d have to configure to transcribe something, and the answer turned out to be precisely zilch.  Once the install was done, I dropped into the directory containing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBdefloUvso">my MP4 video</a>, and typed this:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ whisper wpe-mse-eme-v2.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>Here’s what I got back.  I’ve marked the very few errors.</p>

<pre>
[00:00.000 --&gt; 00:07.000]  In this video, we'll show you several demos showcasing multi-media capabilities in WPE<mark> </mark>WebKit,
[00:07.000 --&gt; 00:11.000]  the official port of the WebKit engine for embedded devices.
[00:11.000 --&gt; 00:18.000]  Each of these demos are running on the low-powered Raspberry Pi 3 seen in the lower right-hand side of the screen here.
[00:18.000 --&gt; 00:25.000]  Infotainment systems and media players often need to consume digital rights-managed videos.
[00:25.000 --&gt; 00:32.000]  <mark>They</mark> tell me, is Michael coming out?  Affirmative, Mike's coming out.
[00:32.000 --&gt; 00:45.000]  Here you can see just that, smooth streaming playback using encrypted media extensions, or EME, with PlayReady 4.
[00:45.000 --&gt; 00:52.000]  Media source extensions, or MSE, are used by many players for greater control over playback.
[00:52.000 --&gt; 01:00.000]  YouTube TV has a whole conformance test suite for this, which WPE has been passing since 2021.
[01:00.000 --&gt; 01:09.000]  The <mark>loan</mark> exceptions here are those tests requiring hardware support not available on the Raspberry Pi 4, but available for other platforms.
[01:09.000 --&gt; 01:16.000]  YouTube TV has a conformance test for EME, which WPE<mark> </mark>WebKit passes with flying colors.
[01:22.000 --&gt; 01:40.000]  Music
[01:40.000 --&gt; 01:45.000]  Finally, perhaps most impressively, we can put all these things together.
[01:45.000 --&gt; 01:56.000]  Here is the dash.js player using MSE, running in a page, and using Widevine DRM to decrypt and play rights-managed video with EME all fluidly.
[01:56.000 --&gt; 02:04.000]  <mark>Music</mark>
[02:04.000 --&gt; 02:09.000]  Remember, all of this is being played back on the same low-powered Raspberry Pi 3.
[02:27.000 --&gt; 02:34.000]  For more about WPE WebKit, please visit WPE<mark> </mark>WebKit.com.
[02:34.000 --&gt; 02:42.000]  For more information about <mark>EGALIA</mark>, or to find out how we can help with your embedded device needs, please visit us at <mark>EGALIA</mark>.com.  </pre>

<p>I am, frankly, astonished.  This has <em>no business</em> being as accurate as it is, for all kinds of reasons.  There’s a lot of jargon and very specific terminology in there, and Whisper nailed pretty much every last bit of it, first time in, no special configuration, nothing.  I didn’t even bump up the model size from the default of <code>small</code>.  I felt a little like that Froyo guy in the animated Hunchback of Notre Dame meme yelling about sorcery or whatever.</p>

<p>True, the output isn’t absolutely perfect.  Let’s review the glitches in reverse order.  The last two errors, turning “Igalia” into “EGALIA”, seems fair enough given I didn’t specify that there would be languages other than English involved.  I routinely have to spell it for my fellow Americans, so no reason to think a codebase could do any better.</p>

<p>The space inserted into “WPEWebKit” (which happens throughout) is similarly understandable.  I’m impressed it understood “WebKit” at all, never mind that it was properly capitalized and not-spaced.</p>

<p>The place where it says <code>Music</code> and I marked it as an error: This is essentially an echoing countdown and then a white-noise roar from rocket engines.  There’s a “music today is just noise” joke in here somewhere, but I’m too hip to find it.</p>

<p>Whisper turning “lone” into “loan” doesn’t particularly faze me, given the difficulty of handling soundalike words.  Hell, just yesterday, I was scribing a conference call and mistakenly recorded “gamut” as “gamma”, and those aren’t even technically homophones.  They just sound like they are.</p>

<p>Rounding out the glitch tour, “Hey” got turned into “They”, which (given the audio quality of that particular part of the video) is still pretty good.</p>

<p>There is one other error I couldn’t mark because there’s nothing to mark, but if you scrutinize the timeline, you’ll see a gap from 02:09.000 and 02:27.000.  In there, a short clip from a movie plays, and there’s a brief dialogue between two characters in not-very-Dutch-accented English there.  It’s definitely louder and more clear than the 00:25.000 –&gt; 00:32.000 bit, so I’m not sure why Whisper just skipped over it.  Manually transcribing that part isn’t a big deal, but it’s odd to see it perform so flawlessly on every other piece of speech and then drop this completely on the floor.</p>

<p>Before posting, I decided to give Whisper another go, this time on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbW1J7huASY">a different video</a>:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>$ whisper wpe-gamepad-support-v3.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>This was the result, with the one actual error marked:</p>

<pre>[00:00.000 --&gt; 00:13.760]  In this video, we demonstrate WPE WebKit's support for the W3C's GamePad API.
[00:13.760 --&gt; 00:20.080]  Here we're running WPE WebKit on a Raspberry Pi 4, but any device that will run WPE WebKit
[00:20.080 --&gt; 00:22.960]  can benefit from this support.
[00:22.960 --&gt; 00:28.560]  The GamePad API provides a JavaScript interface that makes it possible for developers to access
[00:28.560 --&gt; 00:35.600]  and respond to signals from GamePads and other game controllers in a simple, consistent way.
[00:35.600 --&gt; 00:40.320]  Having connected a standard Xbox controller, we boot up the Raspberry Pi with a customized
[00:40.320 --&gt; 00:43.040]  <mark>build route</mark> image.
[00:43.040 --&gt; 00:48.560]  Once the device is booted, we run cog, which is a small, single window launcher made specifically
[00:48.560 --&gt; 00:51.080]  for WPE WebKit.
[00:51.080 --&gt; 00:57.360]  The window cog creates can be full screen, which is what we're doing here.

					<description><![CDATA[One of the more interesting design challenges of “The Effects of Nuclear Weapons” was the fact that it has footnotes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the more interesting design challenges of <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/08/09/recreating-the-effects-of-nuclear-weapons-for-the-web/"><cite>The Effects of Nuclear Weapons</cite></a> was the fact that, like many technical texts, it has footnotes.  Not a huge number, and in fact one chapter has none at all, but they couldn’t be ignored.  And I didn’t want them to be inline between paragraphs or stuck into the middle of the text.</p>

<p>This was actually a case where Chris and I decided to depart a bit from the print layout, because in print a chapter has many pages, but online it has a single page.  So we turned the footnotes into endnotes, and collected them all near the end of each chapter.</p>

<p>Originally I had thought about putting footnotes off to one side in desktop views, such as in the right-hand grid gutter.  After playing with some rough prototypes, I realized this wasn’t going to go the way I wanted it to, and would likely make life difficult in a variety of display sizes between the “big desktop monitor” and “mobile device” realms.  I don’t know, maybe I gave up too easily, but Chris and I had already decided that endnotes were an acceptable adaptation and I decided to roll with that.</p>

<p>So here’s how the footnotes work.  First off, in the main-body text, a footnote marker is wrapped in a <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> element and is a link that points at a named anchor in the endnotes. (I may go back and replace all the superscript elements with styled <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> elements, but for now, they’re superscript elements.)  Here’s <a href="https://atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/effects/glasstone-dolan/chapter1.html#%C2%A71.01">an example from the beginning of Chapter I</a>, which also has a cross-reference link in it, classed as such even though we don’t actually style them any differently than other links.</p>

<pre class="html"><code>This is true for a conventional “high explosive,” such as TNT, as well as for a nuclear (or atomic) explosion,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnote01&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; although the energy is produced in quite different ways (&lt;a href=&quot;#§1.11&quot; class=&quot;xref&quot;&gt;§ 1.11&lt;/a&gt;).</code></pre>

<p>Then, down near the end of the document, there’s a section that contains an ordered list.  Inside that list are the endnotes, which are in part marked up like this:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;li id=&quot;fnote01&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The terms “nuclear” and atomic” may be used interchangeably so far as weapons, explosions, and energy are concerned, but “nuclear” is preferred for the reason given in &lt;a href=&quot;#§1.11&quot; class=&quot;xref&quot;&gt;§ 1.11&lt;/a&gt;.</code></pre>

<p>The list item markers are switched off with CSS, and superscripted numbers stand in their place.  I do it that way because the footnote numbers are important to the content, but also have specific presentation demands that are difficult &#x202F;—&#x2009; nay, impossible&#x202F;—&#x2009;to pull off with normal markers, like raising them superscript-style. (List markers are only affected by <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-lists-3/#marker-properties">a very limited set of properties</a>.)</p>

<p>In order to get the footnote text to align along the start (left) edge of their content and have the numbers hang off the side, I elected to use the old negative-text-indent-positive-padding trick:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>.endnotes li {
	padding-inline-start: 0.75em;
	text-indent: -0.75em;
}</code></pre>

<p>That works great as long as there are never any double-digit footnote numbers, which was indeed the case… until <a href="https://atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/effects/glasstone-dolan/chapter8.html">Chapter VIII</a>.  Dang it.</p>

<p>So, for any footnote number above 9, I needed a different set of values for the indent-padding trick, and I didn’t feel like adding in a bunch of <code>greater-than-nine</code> classes. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator">Following-sibling combinator</a> to the rescue!</p>

<pre class="css"><code>.endnotes li:nth-of-type(9) ~ li {
	margin-inline-start: -0.33em;
	padding-inline-start: 1.1em;
	text-indent: -1.1em;
}</code></pre>

<p>The extra negative start margin is necessary solely to get the text in the list items to align horizontally, though unnecessary if you don’t care about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Okay, so the endnotes looked right when seen in their list, but I needed a way to get back to the referring paragraph after reading a footnote.  Thus, some “backjump” links got added to each footnote, pointing back to the paragraph that referred to them.</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;backjump&quot;&gt;[ref. &lt;a href=&quot;#§1.01&quot;&gt;§ 1.01&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p>With that, a reader can click/tap a footnote number to jump to the corresponding footnote, then click/tap the reference link to get back to where they started.  Which is fine, as far as it goes, but that idea of having footnotes appear in context hadn’t left me.  I decided I’d make them happen, one way or another.</p>

<p>(Throughout all this, I wished more than once <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/footnotes.html">the HTML 3.0 proposal for <code>&lt;fn&gt;</code></a> had gone somewhere other than the dustbin of history and the industry’s collective memory hole.  Ah, well.)</p>

<p>I was thinking I’d need some kind of JavaScript thing to swap element nodes around when it occurred to me that clicking a footnote number would make the corresponding footnote list item a target, and if an element is a target, it can be styled using the <code>:target</code> pseudo-class.  Making it appear in context could be a simple matter of positioning it in the viewport, rather than with relation to the document.  And so:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>.endnotes li:target {
	position: fixed;
	bottom: 0;
	padding-block: 2em 4em;
	padding-inline: 2em;
	margin-inline: -2em 0;
	border-top: 1px solid;
	background: #FFF;
	box-shadow: 0 0 3em 3em #FFF;
	max-width: 45em;
}</code></pre>

<p>That is to say, when an endnote list item is targeted, it’s fixedly positioned against the bottom of the viewport and given some padding and background and a top border and a box shadow, so it has a bit of a halo above it that sets it apart from the content it’s overlaying.  It actually looks pretty sweet, if I do say so myself, and allows the reader to see footnotes without having to jump back and forth on the page.  Now all I needed was a way to make the footnote go away.</p>

<p>Again I thought about going the JavaScript route, but I’m trying to keep to <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/16334#World%20Wide%20Web">the Web’s slower pace layers</a> as much as possible in this project for maximum compatibility over time and technology.  Thus, every footnote gets a “close this” link right after the backjump link, marked up like this:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;a href=&quot;#fnclosed&quot; class=&quot;close&quot;&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>

<p>(I realize that probably looks a little weird, but hang in there and hopefully I can clear it up in the next few paragraphs.)</p>

<p>So every footnote ends with two links, one to jump to the paragraph (or heading) that referred to it, which is unnecessary when the footnote has popped up due to user interaction; and then, one to make the footnote go away, which is unnecessary when looking at the list of footnotes at the end of the chapter.  It was time to juggle display and visibility values to make each appear only when necessary.</p>

<pre class="css"><code>.endnotes li .close {
	display: none;
	visibility: hidden;
}
.endnotes li:target .close {
	display: block;
	visibility: visible;
}
.endnotes li:target .backjump {
	display: none;
	visibility: hidden;
}</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the “close this” links are hidden by default, and revealed when the list item is targeted and thus pops up.  By contrast, the backjump links are shown by default, and hidden when the list item is targeted.</p>

<p>As it now stands, this approach has some upsides and some downsides.  One upside is that, since a URL with an identifier fragment is distinct from the URL of the page itself, you can dismiss a popped-up footnote with the browser’s Back button.  On kind of the same hand, though, one downside is that since a URL with an identifier fragment is distinct from the URL of the page itself, if you consistently use the “close this” link to dismiss a popped-up footnote, the browser history gets cluttered with the opened and closed states of various footnotes.</p>

<p>This is bad because you can get partway through a chapter, look at a few footnotes, and then decide you want to go back one page by hitting the Back button, at which point you discover have to go back through all those footnote states in the history before you actually go back one page.</p>

<p>I feel like this is a thing I can (probably should) address by layering progressively-enhancing JavaScript over top of all this, but I’m still not quite sure how best to go about it.  Should I add event handlers and such so the fragment-identifier stuff is suppressed and the URL never actually changes?  Should I add listeners that will silently rewrite the browser history as needed to avoid this?  Ya got me.  Suggestions or pointers to live examples of solutions to similar problems are welcomed in the comments below.</p>

<p>Less crucially, the way the footnote just appears and disappears bugs me a little, because it’s easy to miss if you aren’t looking in the right place.  My first thought was that it would be nice to have the footnote unfurl from the bottom of the page, but it’s basically impossible (so far as I can tell) to animate the height of an element from <code>0</code> to <code>auto</code>.  You also can’t animate something like <code>bottom: calc(-1 * calculated-height)</code> to <code>0</code> because there is no CSS keyword (so far as I know) that returns the calculated height of an element.  And you can’t really animate from <code>top: 100vh</code> to <code>bottom: 0</code> because animations are of a property’s values, not across properties.</p>

<p>I’m currently considering a quick animation from something like <code>bottom: -50em</code> to <code>0</code>, going on the assumption that no footnote will ever be more than 50 em tall, regardless of the display environment.  But that means short footnotes will slide in later than tall footnotes, and probably appear to move faster.  Maybe that’s okay?  Maybe I should do more of a fade-and-scale-in thing instead, which will be visually consistent regardless of footnote size.  Or I could have them 3D-pivot up from the bottom edge of the viewport!  Or maybe this is another place to layer a little JS on top.</p>

<p>Or maybe I’ve overlooked something that will let me unfurl the way I first envisioned with just HTML and CSS, a clever new technique I’ve missed or an old solution I’ve forgotten.  As before, comments with suggestions are welcome.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In which a colleague and I took the complete text of a 1977 book and recreated it online as faithfully and accessibly as we could.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a
href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/04/26/flexibly-centering-an-element-with-side-aligned-content/">previous post</a>, I wrote about a way to center elements based on their content, without forcing the element to be a specific width, while preserving the interior text alignment.  In this post, I’d like to talk about why I developed that technique.</p>

<p>Near the beginning of this year, fellow Web nerd and nuclear history buff Chris Griffith mentioned a project to put an entire book online: <cite>The Effects of Nuclear Weapons</cite> by Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan, specifically the third (1977) edition.  Like Chris, I own a physical copy of this book, and in fact, the information and tools therein were critical to the creation of <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/gmap/hydesim.html">HYDEsim</a>, way back in the Aughts.  I acquired it while in pursuit of my degree in History, for which I studied the Cold War and the policy effects of the nuclear arms race, from the first bombers to the Strategic Defense Initiative.</p>

<p>I was immediately intrigued by the idea and volunteered my technical services, which Chris accepted.  So we started taking the OCR output of a PDF scan of the book, cleaning up the myriad errors, re-typing the bits the OCR mangled too badly to just clean up, structuring it all with HTML, converting figures to PNGs and photos to JPGs, and styling the whole thing for publication, working after hours and in odd down times to bring this historical document to the Web in a widely accessible form.  The result of all that work <a href="https://atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/effects/glasstone-dolan/">is now online</a>.</p>

<p>That linked page is the best example of the technique I wrote about in the aforementioned <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/04/26/flexibly-centering-an-element-with-side-aligned-content/">previous post</a>: as a Table of Contents, none of the lines actually get long enough to wrap.  Rather than figuring out the exact length of the longest line and centering based on that, I just let CSS do the work for me.</p>

<p>There were a number of other things I invented (probably re-invented) as we progressed.  Footnotes appear at the bottom of pages when the footnote number is activated through the use of the <code>:target</code> pseudo-class and some fixed positioning.  It’s not completely where I wanted it to be, but I think the rest will require JS to pull off, and my aim was to keep the scripting to an absolute minimum.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/enw-math-crop.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/enw-math-crop.png" alt="" class="border" /></a>
<figcaption>LaTeX and MathJax made writing and rendering this sort of thing very easy.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I couldn’t keep the scripting to zero, because we decided early on to use <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> for the many formulas and other mathematical expressions found throughout the text.  I’d never written LaTeX before, and was very quickly impressed by how compact and yet powerful the syntax is.</p>

<p>Over time, I do hope to replace the MathJax-parsed LaTeX with raw MathML for both accessibility and project-weight reasons, but as of this writing, Chromium lacks even halfway-decent MathML support, so we went with the more widely-supported solution.  (My colleague <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/fwang">Frédéric Wang</a> at <a href="https://igalia.com/">Igalia</a> is pushing hard to fix this sorry state of affairs in Chromium, so I do have hopes for a migration to MathML… some day.)</p>

<p>The figures (as distinct from the photos) throughout the text presented an interesting challenge.  To look at them, you’d think SVG would be the ideal image format. Had they come as vector images, I’d agree, but they’re raster scans.  I tried recreating one or two in hand-crafted SVG and quickly determined the effort to create each was significant, and really only worked for the figures that weren’t charts, graphs, or other presentations of data.  For anything that <em>was</em> a chart or graph, the risk of introducing inaccuracies was too high, and again, each would have required an inordinate amount of effort to get even close to correct.  That’s particularly true considering that without knowing what font face was being used for the text labels in the figures, they’d have to be recreated with paths or polygons or whatever, driving the cost-to-recreate astronomically higher.</p>

<p>So I made the figures PNGs that are mostly transparent, except for the places where there was ink on the paper.  After any necessary straightening and some imperfection cleanup in <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a>, I then ran the PNGs through the color-index optimization process I <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2020/04/22/better-image-optimization-by-restricting-the-color-index/">wrote about back in 2020</a>, which got them down to an average of 75 kilobytes each, ranging from 443KB down to 7KB.</p>

<p>At the 11th hour, still secretly hoping for a magic win, I ran them all through <a href="https://svgco.de">svgco.de</a> to see if we could get automated savings.  Of the 161 figures, exactly eight of them were made smaller, which is not a huge surprise, given the source material.  So, I saved those eight for possible future updates and plowed ahead with the optimized PNGs.  Will I return to this again in the future?  Probably.  It bugs me that the figures could be better, and yet aren’t.</p>

<p>It also bugs me that we didn’t get all of the figures and photos fully described in <code>alt</code> text.  I did write up alternative text for the figures in <a href="https://atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/effects/glasstone-dolan/chapter1.html">Chapter I</a>, and a few of the photos have semi-decent captions, but this was something we didn’t see all the way through, and like I say, that bugs me.  If it also bugs you, please feel free to fork <a href="https://github.com/chrisgriffith/glasstone-dolan/">the repository</a> and submit a pull request with good <code>alt</code> text.  Or, if you prefer, you could <a href="https://github.com/chrisgriffith/glasstone-dolan/issues">open an issue</a> and include your suggested <code>alt</code> text that way.  By the image, by the section, by the chapter: whatever you can contribute would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Those image captions, by the way?  In the printed text, they’re laid out as a label (e.g., “Figure 1.02”) and then the caption text follows.  But when the text wraps, it doesn’t wrap below the label.  Instead, it wraps in its own self-contained block instead, with the text fully justified except for the last line, which is centered.  <em>Centered!</em>  So I set up the markup and CSS like this:</p>

<pre class="html"><code>&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;…&quot; alt=&quot;…&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Figure 1.02.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Effects of a nuclear explosion.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>

<pre class="css"><code>figure figcaption {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: max-content auto;
	gap: 0.75em;
	justify-content: center;
	text-align: justify;
	text-align-last: center;
}</code></pre>

<p>Oh CSS Grid, how I adore thee.  And you too, CSS box alignment.  You made this little bit of historical recreation so easy, it felt like cheating.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/enw-table-1-43.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/enw-table-1-43.png" alt="" class="border frame" /></a>
<figcaption>Look at the way it’s all supposed to line up on the ± and one number doesn’t even have a ± and that decimal is just hanging out there in space like it’s no big deal.  LOOK AT IT.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some other things weren’t easy.  The data tables, for example, have a tendency to align columns on the decimal place, even when most but not all of the numbers are integers.  Long, long ago, it was proposed that <code>text-align</code> be allowed a string value, something like <code>text-align: '.'</code>, which you could then apply to a table column and have everything line up on that character.  For a variety of reasons, this was never implemented, a fact which frosts my windows to this day.  In general, I mean, though <em>particularly</em> so for this project.  The lack of it made keeping the presentation historically accurate a right pain, one I may get around to writing about, if I ever overcome my shame.  <em>[Editor’s note: <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2022/08/15/table-column-alignment-with-variable-transforms/">he overcame that shame</a>.]</em></p>

<p>There are two things about the book that we deliberately chose not to faithfully recreate.  The first is the font face.  My best guess is that the book was typeset using something from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/century">Century</a> family, possibly Century Schoolbook (the New version of which was a particular favorite of mine in college).  The very-widely-installed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/cambria">Cambria</a> seems fairly similar, at least to my admittedly untrained eye, and furthermore was designed specifically for screen media, so I went with <code>body</code> text styling no more complicated than this:</p>

<pre class="css"><code>body {
	font: 1em/1.35 Cambria, Times, serif;
	hyphens: auto;
}</code></pre>

<p>I suppose I could have tracked down a free version of Century and used it as a custom font, but I couldn’t justify the performance cost in both download and rendering speed to myself and any future readers.  And the result really did seem close enough to the original to accept.</p>

<p>The second thing we didn’t recreate is the printed-page layout, which is two-column.  That sort of layout can work very well on the book page; it almost always stinks on a Web page.  Thus, the content of the book is rendered online in a single column.  The exceptions are the chapter-ending Bibliography sections and <a href="https://atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/effects/glasstone-dolan/bookindex.html">the book’s Index</a>, both of which contain content compact and granular enough that we could get away with the original layout.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more I could say about how this style or that pattern came about, and maybe someday I will, but for now let me leave you with this: all these decisions are subject to change, and open to input.  If you come up with a superior markup scheme for any of the bits of the book, we’re happy to look at pull requests or issues, and to act on them.  It is, as we say in <a href="https://atomicarchive.com/resources/documents/effects/glasstone-dolan/preface2022.html">our preface to the online edition</a>, a living project.</p>

<p>We also hope that, by laying bare the grim reality of these horrific weapons, we can contribute in some small way to making them a dead and buried technology.</p>

She would have become a teenager this morning, but she didn’t.  She would have had her bat mitzvah ceremony this past weekend, as her best friend in the world actually did, but she didn’t.  <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/10/so-many-nevers/">So many more nevers</a>.
</p>
<p>
I find myself not wanting to talk about it at all, and also wanting to talk about it all the time.  This hole, this void, this screaming silent tear in the world that so many can feel but nobody outside that circle can see.  How do I make someone who didn’t know her understand?  Why would I bring it up with someone who already knows?  Where can I go to fill it, to make things complete?
</p>
<p>
Nowhere, of course.  No where, no why, no how.
</p>
<p>
They tell you that some milestones will be hard to accept, when you become a parent.
</p>
<p>
They don’t tell you how much harder it will be to accept the milestones that were never passed.

					<description><![CDATA[After my post the other day, I found myself reflecting on just how far CSS itself has come in the last 25 years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After my post the other day about <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2021/05/25/25-years-of-css/">how I got started with CSS 25 years ago</a>, I found myself reflecting on just how far CSS itself has come over all those years.  We went from a multi-year agony of incompatible layout models to the tipping point of April 2017, when four major Grid implementations shipped in as many weeks, and were very nearly 100% consistent with each other.  I expressed delight and astonishment at the time, but it still, to this day, amazes me.  Because that’s not what it was like when I started out.  At <em>all</em>.</p>
<p>I know it’s still fashionable to complain about how CSS is all janky and weird and unapproachable, but child, the wrinkles of today are a sunny park stroll compared to the jagged icebound cliff we faced at the dawn of CSS.  Just a few examples, from waaaaay back in the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the initial CSS implementation by Netscape Navigator 4, padding was sometimes a void.  What I mean is, you could give an element a background color, and you could set a border, but if you adding any padding, in some situations it wouldn’t take on the background color, allowing the background of the parent element to show through.  Today, we can recreate that effect like so:
<section class="code-by-example">
<pre class="css"><code>border: 3px solid red;
padding: 0.5em;
background-color: cornflowerblue;
background-clip: content-box;
</code></pre>
<div id="padding-void">
<p>Padding as a void.</p>
</div>
</section>
<style type="text/css">
.code-by-example {
	display: flex;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
	gap: 1em 1.5em;
	margin: 1.5em 0;
}
.code-by-example pre {
	flex-grow: 1;
	margin: 0;
}
#padding-void {
	border: 3px solid red;
	padding: 0.75em;
	background-color: cornflowerblue;
	background-clip: content-box;
	flex-shrink: 0;
	flex-grow: 1;
}
</style>
But we didn’t <em>have</em> <code>background-clip</code> in those days, and backgrounds weren’t supposed to act like that.  It was just a bug that got fixed a few versions later. (It was easier to get browsers to fix bugs in those days, because the web was a lot smaller, and so were the stakes.)  Until that happened, if you wanted a box with border, background, padding, and content in Navigator, you wrapped a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> inside another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, then applied the border and background to the outer and the padding (or a margin, at that point it didn’t matter) to the inner.</li>
<li>In another early Navigator 4 version, pica math was inverted: Instead of 12 points per pica, it was set to 12 picas per point&#x202F;—&#x2009;so <code>12pt</code> equated to <code>144pc</code> instead of <code>1pc</code>.  Oops.</li>
<li>Navigator 4’s handling of color values was another fun bit of bizarreness.  It would try to parse any string as if it were hexadecimal, but it did so in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8333464/475818">this weird way</a> that meant if you declared <code>color: inherit</code> it would render in, as one person put it, “monkey-vomit green”.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer for Windows started out by only tiling background images down and to the right.  Which was fine if you left the origin image in the top left corner, but as soon as you moved it with <code>background-position</code>, the top and left sides of the element just… wouldn’t have any background.  Sort of like Navigator’s padding void!</li>
<li>At one point, IE/Win (as we called it then) just flat out refused to implement <code>background-position: fixed</code>.  I asked someone on that team point blank if they’d ever do it, and got just laughter and then, “Ah no.” (Eventually they relented, opening the door for me to create <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/demo.html">complexspiral</a> and <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/glassy.html">complexspiral distorted</a>.)</li>
<li>For that matter, IE/Win didn’t inherit font sizes into tables.  Which would be annoying even today, but in the era of still needing tables to do page-level layout, it was a real problem.</li>
<li>IE/Win had so many layout bugs, there were whole sites dedicated to cataloging and explaining them.  Some readers will remember, and probably shudder to do so, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030801093541/http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/threepxtest.html">Three-Pixel Text Jog</a>, the <a href="Phantom%20Box%20Bug">Phantom Box Bug</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030801093541/http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/peekaboo.html">Peekaboo Bug</a>, and more.  Or, for that matter, <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/internet-explorer-haslayout-property/"><code>hasLayout</code></a>/<code>zoom</code>.</li>
<li>And perhaps most famous of all, Netscape and Opera implemented the W3C box model (2021 equivalent: <code>box-sizing: content-box</code>) while Microsoft implemented an alternative model (2021 equivalent: <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>), which meant apparently simple CSS meant to size elements would yield different results in different browsers.  Possibly vastly different, depending on the size of the padding and so on.  Which model is more sensible or intuitive doesn’t actually matter here: the inconsistency literally threatened the survival of CSS itself.  Neither side was willing to change to match the other&#x202F;—&#x2009;“we have customers!” was the cry&#x202F;—&#x2009;and nobody could agree on a set of new properties to replace <code>height</code> and <code>width</code>.  It took the invention of <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/doctype/">DOCTYPE switching</a> to rescue CSS from the deadlock, which in turn helped set the stage for layout-behavior properties like <code>box-sizing</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on.  I didn’t even touch on Opera’s bugs, for example.  There was <em>just so much</em> that was wrong.  Enough so that in a fantastic bit of code aikido, <a href="https://tantek.com/">Tantek</a> turned browsers’ parsing bugs against them, redirecting those failures into ways to conditionally deliver specific CSS rules to the browsers that needed them.  A non-JS, non-DOCTYPE form of browser sniffing, if you like&#x202F;—&#x2009;one of the earliest progenitors of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-conditional-3/#at-supports">feature queries</a>.</p>
<p>I said DOCTYPE switching saved CSS, and that’s true, but it’s not the whole truth.  So did the <a href="https://webstandards.org">Web Standards Project</a>, WaSP for short.  A group of volunteers, sick of the chaotic landscape of browser incompatibilities (some intentional) and the extra time and cost of dealing with them, who made the case to developers, browser makers, and the tech press that there was a better way, one where browsers were compatible on the basics like W3C specifications, and could compete on other features.  It was a long, wearying, sometimes frustrating, often derided campaign, but it <em>worked</em>.</p>
<p>The state of the web today, with its vast capability and wide compatibility, owes a great deal to the WaSP and its allies within browser teams.  I remember the time that someone working on a browser&#x202F;—&#x2009;I won’t say which one, or who it was&#x202F;—&#x2009;called me to discuss the way the WaSP was treating their browser. “I want you to be tougher on us,” they said, surprising the hell out of me. “If we can point to outside groups taking us to task for falling short, we can make the case internally to get more resources.”  That was when I fully grasped that corporations aren’t monoliths, and formulated my version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s Razor</a>: “Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by resource constraints.”</p>

<figcaption>The original Acid Test.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to back up what we said when we took browsers to task, we needed test cases.  This not only gave the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/">CSS1 Test Suite</a> a place of importance, but also the tests the WaSP’s CSS Action Committee (aka the <a href="https://archive.webstandards.org/css/members.html">CSS Samurai</a>) devised.  The most famous of these is the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid1">CSS Acid Test</a>, which was <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec5526c.htm">added to the CSS1 Test Suite</a> and was even used as an Easter egg in Internet Explorer 5 for Macintosh.</p>
<p>The need for testing, whether acid or basic, lives on in the <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a>, or WPT for short.  These tests form a vital link in the development of the web.  They allow specification authors to create reference results for the rules in those specifications, and they allow browser makers to see if the code they’re writing yields the correct results.  Sometimes, an implementation fails a test and the implementor can’t figure out why, which leads to a discussion with the authors of the specification, and that can lead to clarifications of the specification, or to fixing flawed tests, or even to both.  Realize just how harmonious browser support for HTML and CSS is these days, and know that WPT deserves a big part of the credit for that harmony.</p>
<p>As much as the Web Standards Project set us on the right path, the Web Platform Tests keep us on that path.  And I can’t lie, I feel like the WPT is to the CSS1 Test Suite much like feature queries are to those old CSS parser hacks.  The latter are much greater and more powerful than than the former, but there’s an evolutionary line that connects them.  Forerunners and inheritors.  Ancestors and descendants.</p>
<p>It’s been a real privilege to be present as CSS first emerged, to watch as it’s developed into the powerhouse it is today, and to be a part of that story&#x202F;—&#x2009;a story that is, I believe, far from over.  There are still many ways for CSS to develop, and still so many things we have yet to discover in its feature set.  It’s still an entrancing language, and I hope I get to be entranced for another 25 years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It was the morning of Tuesday, May 7th, 1996 and I was sitting in the Ambroisie conference room of the CNIT in Paris, France having my mind repeatedly blown.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the morning of Tuesday, May 7th and I was sitting in the Ambroisie conference room of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_of_New_Industries_and_Technologies"><abbr title="Centre of New Industries and Technologies">CNIT</abbr></a> in Paris, France having my mind repeatedly blown by an up-and-coming web technology called “Cascading Style Sheets”, 25 years ago this month.</p>

<p>I’d been the Webmaster at <a href="https://cwru.edu">Case Western Reserve University</a> for just over two years at that point, and although I was aware of table-driven layout, I’d resisted using it for the main campus site.  All those table tags just felt… wrong.  Icky.  And yet, I could readily see how not using tables hampered my layout options.  I’d been holding out for something better, but increasingly unsure how much longer I could wait.</p>

<p>Having successfully talked the university into paying my way to Paris to attend <a href="https://www.w3.org/Conferences/WWW5/"><abbr title="The Fifth International World Wide Web Conference">WWW5</abbr></a>, partly by having <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/talks/www5/borealis.html">a paper</a> accepted for presentation, I was now sitting in the W3C track <a href="https://www.w3.org/Conferences/WWW5/fich_html/technical_program.html">of the conference</a>, seeing examples of CSS working in a browser, and it just felt… <em>right</em>.  When I saw a single word turned a rich blue and 100-point size with just a single element and a few simple rules, I was utterly hooked.  I still remember the buzzing tingle of excitement that encircled my head as I felt like I was seeing a real shift in the web’s power, a major leap forward, and exactly what I’d been holding out for.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/www5-notes-004.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/www5-notes-004.jpg" alt="" class="framed" /></a>
<figcaption>Page 4, HTML 3.2.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking back at my hand-written notes (laptops were heavy, bulky, battery-poor, and expensive in those days, so I didn’t bother taking one with me) from the conference, which I still have, I find a lot that interests me.  HTTP 1.1 and HTML 3.2 were announced, or at least explained in detail, at that conference.  I took several notes on the brand-new <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> element and wrote “CENTER is <u>in</u>!”, which I <em>think</em> was an expression of excitement.  Ah, to be so young and foolish again.</p>

<p>There are other tidbits: a claim that “standards will trail innovation”&#x202F;—&#x2009;something that I feel has really only happened in the past decade or so&#x202F;—&#x2009;and that “Math has moved to ActiveMath”, the latter of which is a term I freely admit I not only forgot, but still can’t recall in any way whatsoever.</p>

<figure style="clear: right;">
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/www5-notes-006-009.jpeg"><img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/www5-notes-006-009.jpeg" alt="" class="framed" /></a>
<figcaption>My first impressions of CSS, split for no clear reason across two pages.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But I did record that CSS had about 35 properties, and that you could associate it with markup using <code>&lt;LINK REL=STYLESHEET&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;STYLE&gt;…&lt;/STYLE&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;H1 STYLE="…"&gt;</code>.  There’s a question&#x202F;—&#x2009;“Gradient backgrounds?”&#x202F;—&#x2009;that I can’t remember any longer if it was a note to myself to check later, or something that was floated as a possibility during the talk.  I did take notes on image backgrounds, text spacing, indents (which I managed to misspell), and more.</p>

<p>What I didn’t know at the time was that CSS was still largely vaporware.  Implementations were coming, sure, but the demos I’d seen were very narrowly chosen and browser support was minimal at best, not to mention wildly inconsistent.  I didn’t discover any of this until I got back home and started experimenting with the language.  With a printed copy of the CSS1 specification next to me, I kept trying things that seemed like they should work, and they didn’t.  It didn’t matter if I was using the market-dominating behemoth that was Netscape Navigator or the scrappy, fringe-niche new kid Internet Explorer: very little seemed to line up with the specification, and almost nothing worked consistently across the browsers.</p>

<p>So I started creating little test pages, tackling a single property on each page with one test per value (or value type), each just a simple assertion of what should be rendered along with a copy of the CSS used on the page.  Over time, my completionist streak drove me to expand this smattering of tests to cover everything in CSS1, and the perfectionist in me put in the effort to make it easy to navigate.  That way, when a new browser version came out, I could run it through the whole suite of tests and see what had changed and make note of it.</p>

<p>Eventually, those tests became <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/">the CSS1 Test Suite</a>, and the way it looks today is pretty much how I built it.  Some tests were expanded, revised, and added, plus it eventually all got poured into a basic test harness that I think someone else wrote, but most of the tests&#x202F;—&#x2009;and the overall visual design&#x202F;—&#x2009;were my work, color-blindness insensitivity and all.  Those tests are basically what got me into the Working Group as an Invited Expert, way back in the day.</p>

<p>Before that happened, though, with all those tests in hand, I was able to compile CSS browser support information into a big color-coded table, which I published on the CWRU web site (remember, I was Webmaster) and made freely available to all.  The support data was stored in a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker">FileMaker Pro</a> database, with custom dropdown fields to enter the Y/N/P/B values and lots of fields for me to enter template fragments so that I could export to HTML.  That support chart eventually migrated to the late <cite>Web Review</cite>, where it came to be known as “the Mastergrid”, a term I find funny in retrospect because grid layout was still two decades in the future, and anyway, it was just a large and heavily styled data table.  Because I wasn’t against tables for tabular data.  I just didn’t like the idea of using them solely for layout purposes.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010204021400/http://www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml">one of the later versions of Mastergrid in the Wayback Machine</a>, with its heavily classed and yet still endearingly clumsy markup.  My work maintaining the Mastergrid, and articles I wrote for <cite>Web Review</cite>, led to my first book for O’Reilly (currently in its <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/books/css-tdg/">fourth edition</a>), which led to my being asked to write <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/books">other books</a> and <a href="https://noti.st/meyerweb">speak at conferences</a>, which led to my deciding to <a href="https://aneventapart.com">co-found a conference</a>… and a number of other things besides.</p>

<p>And it all kicked off 25 years ago this month in a conference room in Paris, May 7th, 1996.  What a journey it’s been.   I wonder now, in the latter half of my life, what CSS&#x202F;—&#x2009;what the web itself&#x202F;—&#x2009;will look like in another 25 years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today marks one month at Igalia.  It’s been a lot, and there’s more to come, but it’s been a really great experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks one month at <a href="https://igalia.com/">Igalia</a>.  It’s been a lot, and there’s more to come, but it’s been a really great experience.  I get to do things I really enjoy and value, and Igalia supports and encourages all of it without trying to steer me in specific directions.  I’ve been incredibly lucky to experience that kind of working environment twice in my life&#x202F;—&#x2009;and the other one was <a href="https://aneventapart.com/">an outfit I helped create</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of what I’ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally got up to speed on what Igalia is working on (spoiler: a <strong>lot</strong>).</li>
<li>Redesigned parts of <a href="https://wpewebkit.org">wpewebkit.org</a>, fixed a few outstanding bugs, edited most of the rest. (The site runs on <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, so I’ve been learning that as well.)</li>
<li>Wrote a bunch of CSS tests/demos that will form the basis for other works, like articles and videos.</li>
<li>Drafted a few of said articles.  As I write this, two are very close to being complete, and a third is almost ready for editing.</li>
<li>Edited some pages on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> (MDN), clarifying or upgrading text in some places and replacing unclear examples in others.</li>
<li>Joined the <a href="https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs">Open Web Docs</a> Steering Committee.</li>
<li>Reviewed various specs and proposals (e.g., <a href="https://miriamsuzanne.com" rel="met colleague acquaintance">Miriam</a>’s very interesting <a href="https://github.com/oddbird/css-sandbox/blob/main/src/scope/explainer.md"><code>@scope</code> proposal</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s not all!  Here’s what I have planned for the next few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>More contributions to MDN, much of it in the CSS space, but also branching out into documenting some up-and-coming APIs in areas that are fairly new to me.  (Details to come!)</li>
<li>Contributions to the <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a> (WPT), once I get familiar with how that process is structured.</li>
<li>Articles on topics that will include (but are not limited to!) gaps in CSS, logical properties, and styling based on writing direction.  I haven’t actually settled on outlets for those yet, so if you’d be interested in publishing any of them, hit me up.  I usually aim for about a thousand words, including example markup and CSS.</li>
<li>Very likely will rejoin the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members.en.html">CSS Working Group</a> after a <small>(mumblecough)</small>-year absence.</li>
<li>Assembling a Raspberry Pi system to test out <a href="https://wpewebkit.org">WPEWebKit</a> in its native, embedded environment and get a handle on how to create a “setting up WPEWebKit for total embedded-device noobs”, of which I am one.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one will be an entirely new area for me, as I’ve never really worked with an embedded-device browser before.  WPEWebKit is a WebKit port, actually <em>the</em> official WebKit port for embedded devices, and as such is aggressively tuned for performance and low resource demand.  I’m really looking forward to not only seeing what it’s like to use it, but also how I might be able to leverage it into some interesting projects.</p>
<p>WPEWebKit is one of the reasons why Igalia is such a big contributor to WebKit, helping drive its standards support forward and raise its interoperability with other browser engines.  There’s a thread of self-interest there: a better WebKit means a better WPEWebKit, which means more capable embedded devices for Igalia’s clients.  But after a month on the inside, I feel comfortable saying most of Igalia’s commitment to interoperability is philosophical in nature&#x202F;—&#x2009;they truly believe that more consistency and capability in web browsers benefits everyone.  As in, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMNFehJIi0E"><strong><tt>THIS IS FOR EVERYONE</tt></strong></a>.</p>
<p>And to go along with that, more knowledge and awareness is seen as an unvarnished good, which is why they’re having me working on MDN content.  To that end, I’m putting out an invitation here and now: if you come across a page on MDN about CSS or HTML that confuses you, or seems inaccurate, or just doesn’t have much information at all, please get in touch to let me know, <strong>particularly</strong> if you are <em>not</em> a native English speaker.</p>
<p>I can’t offer translation services, unfortunately, but I can do my best to make the English content of MDN as clear as possible.  Sometimes, what makes sense to a native English speaker is obscure or unclear to others.  So while this offer is open to everyone, don’t hold back if you’re struggling to parse the English.  It’s more likely the English is unclear and imprecise, and I’d like to erase that barrier if I can.</p>
<p>The best way to submit a report is to <a href="mailto:emeyer@igalia.com?Subject=[MDN]">send me email with <tt>[MDN]</tt> and the URL of the page you’re writing about</a> in the subject line.  If you’re writing about a collection of pages, put the URLs into the email body rather than the subject line, but please keep the <tt>[MDN]</tt> in the subject so I can track it more easily.  You can also <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb">ping me on Twitter</a>, though I’ll probably ask you to email me so I don’t lose track of the report.  Just <abbr title="For Your Information">FYI</abbr>.</p>
<p>I feel like there was more, but this is getting long enough and anyway, it already seems like a lot.  I can’t wait to share more with you in the coming months!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The first week on the job at Igalia was… it was good, y’all.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first week on the job at <a href="https://igalia.com/">Igalia</a> was… it was good, y’all.  Upon formally joining the Support Team, got myself oriented, built a series of tests-slash-demos that will be making their way into some forthcoming posts and videos, and forked a copy of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> (MDN) so I can start making edits and pushing them to the public site.  In fact, <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/4af179d666bb865862f6cc5b1361346d2e6d8061#diff-37aea9089a7b47a834b7baa736bda298d1a473b71a4f8d3eb713f03bef6e3a00">the first of those edits</a> landed Sunday night!  And there was the usual setting up accounts and figuring out internal processes and all that stuff.</p>

<figure class="standalone">

<figcaption>Illustrating the uses of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-block"><code>border-block</code></a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To be perfectly honest, a lot of my first-week momentum was provided by the rest of the Support Team, and setting expectations during the interview process.  You see, at one point in the past I had a position like this, and I had problems meeting expectations.  This was partly due to my inexperience working in that sort of setting, but also partly due to a lack of clear communication about expectations.  Which I know because I thought I was doing well in meeting them, and then was told otherwise in evaluations.</p>

<p>So when I was first talking with the folks at Igalia, I shared that experience.  Even though I knew Igalia has a different approach to management and evaluation, I told them repeatedly, “If I take this job, I want you to point me in a direction.”  They’ve done exactly that, and it’s been great.  Special thanks to <a href="https://bkardell.com/" rel="met contact co-worker colleague">Brian Kardell</a> in this regard.</p>

<p>I’m already looking forward to what we’re going to do with the demos I built and am still refining, and to making more MDN edits, including some upgrades to code examples.  And I’ll have more to say about MDN editing soon.  Stay tuned!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today is my first day as a full-time employee at Igalia, where I’ll be doing a whole lot of things I love to do.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is my first day as a full-time employee at <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a>, where I’ll be doing a whole lot of things I love to do: document and explain web standards at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/"><abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr></a> and other places, participate in standards work at the W3C, take on some webmaster duties, and play a part in planning Igalia’s strategy with respect to advancing the web.  And likely other things!</p>

<p>I’ll be honest, this is a pretty big change for me.  I haven’t worked for anyone other than myself since 2003.  But the last time I did work for someone else, it was for Netscape (slash AOL slash Time Warner) as a Standards Evangelist, a role I very much enjoyed.  In many ways, I’m taking that role back up at Igalia, in a company whose values and structure are much more in line with my own.  I’m really looking forward to finding out what we can do together.</p>

<p>If the name Igalia doesn’t ring any bells, don’t worry: nobody outside the field has heard of them, and most people inside the field haven’t either.  So, remember when CSS Grid came to browsers back in 2017?  Igalia did the implementation that landed in Safari and Chromium.  They’ve done a lot of other things besides that&#x202F;—&#x2009;some of which I’ll be helping to spread the word about&#x202F;—&#x2009;but it’s the thing that web folks will be most likely to recognize.</p>

<p>This being my first day and all, I’m still deep in the setting up of logins and filling out of forms and general orienting of oneself to a new team and set of opportunities to make a positive difference, so there isn’t much more to say besides I’m stoked and planning to say more a little further down the road.  For now, onward!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes, what is still is the most transient of all.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had been awake since one in the morning.  She had been unconscious since three in the morning.</p>
<p>We’d been taking turns sleeping with Rebecca in the nights leading up to that day, six years ago today, and on the final night it had been my turn.  I was woken by a sound, from her or by her I still don’t know, and I saw that she was awake.  And had vomited.  And still could barely move.  And I knew this was it.</p>
<p>Kat called the hospice nurse to come and give her the drugs to take away the pain, and we waited, sick with despair and doing everything we could not to show it.</p>
<p>We gently held her as she trembled.  We kissed her head through her curly hair, told her that we were here with her and that she could go, not to be afraid, we’d be there with her soon.  Lying to her, now, finally, so far past the point where truth was kind or helpful, telling her whatever we thought would take away even a tiny slice of the fear.  Shamelessly, literally shamelessly, weaponizing all the trust we had built up over the years by telling her the truth her whole life, to ease, if we could, the last hours of it.</p>
<p>Her eyes were wide, even for her.  They barely blinked.  We could still catch her attention, but it was so much harder now.  The trembling increased, and then, eyes somehow still wider, she started to claw frantically at her temples, trying to dig out the thing that was killing her.  Or just to somehow relieve the pain.</p>
<p>I had to restrain her, catch her small wrists in my hands, wrap my arms around her arms and shaking small body and brokenly tell her <em>no, stop, I know, I know, I’m so sorry, we want it to stop too, I know, we love you.</em></p>
<p>The nurse was finally there and administered a lot of narcotics.  Not enough to kill her outright, but enough to take away the pain.  And consciousness.  I almost asked him to double the dose, or triple it, whatever was necessary to end things quickly and painlessly.  I stopped only because I realized the position that would put him in.  And that if it were an option, he’d already have offered it.</p>
<p>Waiting for the drugs to work, we read her her favorite stories, holding books up one at a time and asking if she wanted this one, this one, this one.  Her head would jerk in a prototype of a nod, and we’d open that book and read, taking turns, voices somehow as clear and steady as if we were doing normal bedtime stories.  I made a list as we went, because I knew I’d want to know later.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mulligan_and_His_Steam_Shovel"><cite>Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel</cite></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1572485.How_the_Sun_Was_Brought_Back_to_the_Sky"><cite>How the Sun Was Brought Back to the Sky</cite></a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline"><cite>Madeline</cite></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1870274.Jump_Rope_Magic"><cite>Jump Rope Magic</cite></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Halfway through that last, the drugs finally took hold, and she slipped into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Or really, semi-consciousness: some part of her was still aware of her surroundings.  Every time Kat shifted or drew away for a moment, Rebecca would whimper quietly, and only stop when she could hear and feel Kat reassuring her.  She only did so for me when I got up from the bed entirely.  I would assure her that I would be back in a minute or two, that I wasn’t going away for good.  That was enough to quiet her.  She trusted us so much.</p>
<p>Shortly before dawn, we started sending texts to loved ones.  <em>This is it.  If you want to say goodbye, you need to come today.  She has hours left.</em>  And asked them to spread the word, so others would know to come.</p>
<p>Just after dawn, at 7:22 in the morning, she crossed another threshold.</p>
<p><em>Happy birthday, Rebecca</em>, we told her with quietly trembling voices.  <em>You made it.  You really did.  You’re a great big six year old now.  We love you so much.</em></p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>So many people came to see her one last time on her sixth birthday, drifted in and out of her room, a slowly shifting cast of characters supporting her, us, each other, themselves.  I don’t really remember how it felt then, barely remember who was there and who was not, but looking back now it’s like those movie scenes where one person is still, sharply in focus, while long-exposure blurs of people moving around them draw a contrast between what matters and what is incidental, between transience and permanence.</p>
<p>Sometimes, what is still is the most transient of all.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, there were signs the drugs weren’t enough, that she was going to start seizing despite everything.  Which in turn meant there was a risk she’d come back to a consciousness filled with nothing but incomprehensible pain.  We weren’t sure what we could do.  She’d been lying on her back all day, so nearly motionless, body flaring with fever, shallow breaths coming and going in a rhythm I kept falling into, the way you do when your child is in distress.</p>
<p>Kat looked across at me and said, <em>She’s a side sleeper.</em></p>
<p>We rolled Rebecca onto her sleeping side, her right side, and her breath hitched, drew in slowly, and then flowed out deeply, contentedly.  Her breathing stayed slow and deep, the rhythm of sleep, comforting, except it gradually got slower and slower and slower.  Stretched out more and more over half an hour, eventually slow enough that when it stopped altogether, we almost didn’t notice.</p>
<p>We checked for pulse.  Breath.  Pulse again.  Nothing.  For a minute.  Two.</p>
<p>A sound came from my throat that I know now is the true sound of ultimate suffering&#x202F;—&#x2009;and as if startled by it, she drew in another breath, choking me off.</p>
<p>We begged her to stop fighting, told her it was okay to go, we loved her, we loved her, we loved her.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, pulse and breath stopped again.  And Rebecca was gone forever.</p>
<p>Rebecca, who we knew so well.</p>
<p>Rebecca, who we had barely gotten to know.</p>
<p>Rebecca, who we will never get to know.</p>
<p>Time has moved on, as we have, and yet some parts of us have not.  Some parts of us are caught there, six years ago today, able to do nothing but watch her slowly slip away, literally helpless to do anything except try to soothe her through the haze of drugs and thickening darkness with our words, our touch, our presence, our love.  Parts of us frozen in that passage, unchanging.</p>
<p>Like Rebecca is now, forever, and should not be.</p>
<blockquote class="poem">When I was One,
I had just begun.
When I was Two,
I was nearly new.
When I was Three
I was hardly me.
When I was Four,
I was not much more.
When I was Five,
I was just alive.
But now I am Six,
I’m as clever as clever,
So I think I’ll be six now for ever and ever.
<p class="attrib">&#x202F;—&#x2009;‘Now We Are Six’, A.A. Milne</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ended <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2020/04/09/css-naked-day-2020/">my observance of CSS Naked Day 2020</a> by launching an entirely new design for meyerweb.  I’m calling it <strong>Hamonshū</strong> after the source from which I adapted most of the graphic elements.  I’ve been working on it sporadically in my free time since mid-January, finally coming to a place I thought was ready to launch in late March.</p>

<p>Naked Day was a convenient way to change over the structure of pages while there was no design, which probably makes it sound like that’s the only reason I even observed it.  To the contrary, I hadn’t planned to launch the new design until June 8th of this year&#x202F;—&#x2009;but once I decided on going style-naked, I realized it was the perfect opportunity to make the switch.</p>

<p>I might still have delayed, if not for everything happening in the world right now.  But Cameron Moll <a href="https://twitter.com/cameronmoll/status/1239971692144807938">said it best</a> as he recently launched a new design: “Deploying in the middle of a pandemic seems so unimportant at the moment. Or maybe there&#8217;s no better time for it.”  That last sentence resonated with me unexpectedly deeply, and came to mind again as I took the CSS away for Naked Day.</p>

<p>I’ll have quite a few things to say about the design in the future: things I learned, techniques I used, bits I really like, that sort of thing.  In this post, I want to say a bit about its genesis.</p>

<p>It all started when someone&#x202F;—&#x2009;I’ve since lost track of who, or even where it happened&#x202F;—&#x2009;brought my attention to <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Mori%2C+Yu%CC%84zan%2C+-1917%22"><cite>Hamonshū</cite>, Vols. 1-3</a>, available on the Internet Archive thanks to the Smithsonian Institution.  <cite>Hamonshū</cite>, a word which I understand roughly translates into English as “wave forms” or “wave design”, is a three-volume set of art studies of water.  Created by Yūzan Mori and published in 1903, I had never heard of it before, but the sketches immediately appealed to me.  You can get an preview of some of Yūzan’s art in this <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/hamonshu-a-japanese-book-of-wave-and-ripple-designs-1903">article from Public Domain Review</a>, or just go to the source (linked previously, as well as in the footer of the site) and immerse yourself in it.</p>

<p>As I absorbed Yūzan’s ink studies of ocean waves, rivers, fountains, and more, the elements of a design began to form in my head.  I won’t say I <em>saw</em> it&#x202F;—&#x2009;being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasic</a>, I couldn’t&#x202F;—&#x2009;but certain sketches suggested themselves as components of a layout, and stuck with me.</p>

<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/1953.629_web.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption><cite>Tall Bamboo and Distant Mountains, after Wang Meng</cite>, Wang Hui 王翬, 1694</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Early on, I had thought to combine elements from <cite>Hamonshū</cite> with other artwork, primarily ink landscape paintings from the Qing Dynasty and Edo periods: two such examples being <a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1953.629"><cite>Tall Bamboo and Distant Mountains, after Wang Meng</cite></a> (Wang Hui 王翬, 1694) and <a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1970.69"><cite>View of West Lake</cite></a> (Ike Taiga, 1700s).  I made attempts, but the elements never really combined properly.  I eventually realized I was trying to combine close-up studies of water with adaptations of much larger works, and the scale of the brush strokes was clashing.  At that point, I abandoned the paintings and concentrated exclusively on <cite>Hamonshū</cite>.</p>

<p>As the various design elements came together, I went looking for fonts to use.  I originally thought to use variable fonts, but I kept coming back to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=im+fell">IM Fell</a>, a typeface I’d seen <a href="http://simonstl.com/">Simon St. Laurent</a> use and had put to my own purposes in an experimental typeset of Neal Stephenson’s <cite>Mother Earth Mother Board</cite>.  IM Fell has a sort of nautical feel to it, at least to me, which fit nicely with the water elements I was adapting from <cite>Hamonshū</cite>, so I ended up using it as a “site elements” typeface.  It’s what’s used for the site name in the header, the main navigation links, metadata for posts, sidebar heading text, the <code>h1</code> on most pages, and so on.</p>

<p>Originally I used IM Fell for the titles of blog posts like this one, but it didn’t feel quite right.  I think it caused the titles to blend into the rest of the design a little too much unless I kept it relatively huge.  I needed something that felt consistent, but distinguished itself at the smaller sizes I needed for post titles.  I went back to Google Fonts and scrolled through the choices until I narrowed down to a few faces, of which <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=eczar&amp;selection.family=Eczar:400,500,600,700,800|IM+Fell+English+SC|IM+Fell+English:400,400i">Eczar</a> was the eventual winner.  In addition to using Eczar for post titles, I also employ it in the site’s footer, at least wherever IM Fell <em>isn’t</em> used.  The general body copy of the site is Georgia Pro, falling back to Georgia or a generic serif as needed.</p>

<p>One of the limitations I set for myself was to be reasonably lightweight, and that was a major part of the process.  The details merit a post or two of their own, but my overall goal was to get even the post archive pages under a megabyte in total.  I’m pleased to say I was able to get there, for the most part.  As an example, the <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/">main post archive page</a> is, as I write this (but before I posted it) 910.98KB, and that includes the various photographs and other images embedded in posts.  The time to <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> over WiFi is consistently below 200<abbr title="milliseconds">ms</abbr>, 400-500ms on “Regular 3G”, and 500-600ms on “Regular 2G”, all with the local cache disabled, at least when the server is responding well.  I still have work to do in this area, but I was comfortable enough with the current state to launch the design publicly.</p>

<p>Since I was redesigning anyway, I did some sprucing up of various subpages.  Most notable are the <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/">Toolbox</a> and <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/writing.html">Writing</a> pages, which use a number of techniques to improve organization and appearance.  I still think the top part of the Writing page could use some work, but it’s leagues better than it used to be.  The one major page I’d like to further upgrade is <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/">CSS Work</a>, but I’m still looking for an approach that is distinct from the other pages, yet thematically consistent.  If I can’t find one, I’ll probably take the same general approach I did for Toolbox.  I also rewrote some of the microcopy, such as the metadata (publication date, categories, etc.) at the bottom of blog posts, to be more evocative of the feel I was going for.</p>

<p>Late in the process, I got a welcome assist from <a href="https://plasticmind.com">Jesse Gardner</a>, who had seen a preview of article design.  He had the idea to make a traced SVG version of the “Hand Made With Love” necklace charm from the masthead of the previous design, and then he just up and did it and sent me the file.  You’ll find it in the footer of the site.  It isn’t interactive, although it may in the future.  I haven’t decided yet.</p>

<p>I really hope you enjoy the new look.  It’s the first design I’ve done that wasn’t cribbed off someone else’s site in, oh, 15-20 years, give or take, and I’m rather proud of it.  It won’t win any awards, but it makes the statement I want it to make, and visiting my own site gives me a little glow of satisfaction.  I don’t know if I could ask for more than that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been working from home for (checks watch) almost 19 years now, and I’d love to share some tips with you all on how to make it work for you.</p>

<p>Except I can’t, because this has been incredibly disruptive for me.  See, my home is usually otherwise empty during the day&#x202F;—&#x2009;spouse at work, kids at school&#x202F;—&#x2009;which means I can crank up the beats and swear to my heart’s content at my code typos.  Now, not only do I have to wear headphones and monitor my language when I work, I <em>also</em> am surrounded by office-mates who basically play video games and watch cat videos all day, except for those times when I really get focused on a task, when they magically sense it’s the <em>perfect</em> time to come ask me random questions that could have waited, derailing my focus and putting me back at square one.</p>

<p>Which, to most of you used to working in an office setting, I suppose might seem vaguely familiar.  I’m not used to it at all.</p>

<p>Here’s what I <strong>can</strong> tell you: if you’re having trouble focusing on work, or anything else, it’s not that you’re terrible at working from home or bad at your job.  It’s that you’re doing this in a set of circumstances completely unprecedented in our lifetimes.  It’s that you’re doing this while worried not only about keeping yourself and your loved ones safe from a global pandemic, but probably also worried about your continued employment&#x202F;—&#x2009;not because you’re doing badly, but because the economy is on the verge of freezing up completely.  No spending means no business income means no salaries means no money to spend.</p>

<p>We can hope for society-level measures to unjam the economic engine, debt leniency or zero-interest loans or Universal Basic Income or what have you, but until those measures exist and begin to work together, we’re all stumbling scared in a pitch-black forest.  Take it from someone who has been engulfed by overwhelming, frightening, pitiless circumstances before: Work can be a respite, but it’s hard to sustain that retreat.  It’s hard to motivate yourself to even think about work, let alone do a good job.</p>

<p>Be forgiving of yourself.  Give yourself time and space to process the fear, to work through it and you.  Find a place for yourself in relation to it, so that you can exist beside it without it always disrupting your thoughts.  That’s the only way I know to free up any mental resources to try to do good work.  It also puts you in a place where you can act with some semblance of reason, instead of purely from fear.</p>

<p>Stay safe, friends.  We have a long, unknown road ahead.  Adjustment will be a long time in coming.  Support each other as much as you can.  Community is, in the end, the most resilient and replenishing force we have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
Six years ago, we participated in our first <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org">St. Baldrick’s</a> event.  Carolyn was preparing to shave her head to support Rebecca, who was still very much alive and, we thought, cancer-free.  And Joshua, the little brother at just over three years old, had apparently decided to do the same to his head, although he didn’t tell us until the day of the event.
</p>

<img decoding="async" src="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/wp-content/uploads/knight-of-the-bald-table.png" alt="Knight of the Bald Table logo" style="shape-outside: circle(50% at center); shape-margin: 0.5em; float: right; max-width: 40%;" />

<p class="indent-fix">
This year, Joshua will be participating in St. Baldrick’s for the seventh time in a row, shaving his head to raise money for and awareness of the campaign to cure cancers in memory of his sister at <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/events/clevelandheights2020">the Cleveland Heights event</a> on Sunday, March 15th.  He’s been letting his hair grow all year for maximum payoff: literally, he has not had a single hair cut since last year’s St. Baldrick’s event.  He also recently had Carolyn dye it blue, which means he’s giving off a strong JRPG vibe.  (He rolls his eyes whenever I mention this.)
</p>
<p>
This being his seventh year, Joshua will officially become a <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/league/">Knight of the Bald Table</a>.  In his honor, I will be his squire for the day&#x202F;—&#x2009;which means I will be shaving my head as well, for the first time.
</p>
<p>
If you can, please support Joshua’s knighting shave by <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/mypage/1048837/2020">supporting his fundraising efforts</a>.  He’s set an ambitious goal, but I’m pretty sure that working together, we can well exceed it.  You can do it in honor of him, or in honor of his sister, or both; but please, if you can give him a boost, please do so.  Any amount will help, as will spreading the word on <i>les médias sociaux</i>.  Thank you.
